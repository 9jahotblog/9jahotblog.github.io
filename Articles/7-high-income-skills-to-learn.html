                        <p><strong>New year, new beginnings.</strong> If one of your goals is to make more money this year, then read this till the end. Here you will see 7 in-demand skills that can skyrocket your income in 2023.</p>
                        <p>These skills can be done remotely, so you can choose to work from home, without owning an office or working in a typical 9 to 5 job.</p>
                        <p>Before going further, please note that the skills are not listed in any particular order, and they all offer great opportunities to earn in dollars, and most of them can be learned with just your smartphone and the internet.</p>
                        <p>So, below are 7 high income skills to learn:</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>1) Copywriting:</strong></h4>
                        <p>Copywriting is a skill that every business needs, and copywriters are always sought after. It involves writing copies that will convince customers or potential customers to buy a product or pay for a service. This can generate more sales revenue for businesses, hence it is not hard to understand why copywriters are needed.</p>
                        <p>Copywriters write product descriptions, sales letters, ads, etc. According to Glassdoor, the average monthly income of copywriters in Lagos is 252,500 naira. This can be even higher when you master the skill and apply to work remotely for foreign companies/businesses.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>2) Data Analysis and Data Science:</strong></h4>
                        <p>With the boom of digital technologies and increasing globalization, one key thing separating successful businesses from others is their ability to make informed decisions using data. Data analysts/scientists help companies/businesses make sense of data, and use the insights to make key decisions (for example, where to advertise their products).</p>
                        <p>As a Data Analyst, you can earn an average of 480,000 naira in Nigeria, according to Glassdoor.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>3) Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong></h4>
                        <p>SEO is definitely one of the hotshots in the online business world. When you search for anything online, you are more likely to click on the first few links or websites that appear on the first page. SEO ensures that sites rank higher on the search engine page, so that it will be more visible to people and potential clients/customers on the internet. The more people see a website and its products, the more likely it is for that business to generate revenue.</p>
                        <p>Payscale says SEO professionals earn about 1 million naira per year in Nigeria. But this can be as high as $60,000 per year in the US, so it is advised to seek remote opportunities to work for foreign businesses.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>4) Web Design and Web Development:</strong></h4>
                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of conducting business online. Many businesses are harnessing the interconnectedness of the internet, and an even greater number of businesses are expected to join the queue. As such, web designers and web developers are needed to help these companies/businesses create websites.</p>
                        <p>Web design and web development are not exactly the same. They use different approaches, but their primary aim is to create a website. Web development involves coding, while web design uses templates on platforms like WordPress. Notwithstanding, there are great earning opportunities for both web designers and web developers.</p>
                        <p>Web designers can earn between 150,000 and 200,000 naira monthly. Note that the income range is not fixed, but depends on your skill level and the business you get to work for, so you can earn much higher.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>5) Graphic Design:</strong></h4>
                        <p>Visual appeal is very important; people are easily attracted to pictures and other visuals. Graphic designers make fliers, infographics, logos, and the like. With so many great templates and free resources available, it is very easy to master, and a great app to start with is Canva.</p>
                        <p>Depending on how well you can design and how you market yourself, you can earn from 140,000 naira and above monthly as a graphic designer. The demand for visually appealing content is ever-increasing, with businesses needing logos, banners, social media graphics, and much more to engage their audience and establish a brand identity. By leveraging platforms like Behance and Dribbble to showcase your portfolio, you can attract clients from all over the world, increasing your earning potential substantially. In Nigeria, Somolu is considered the home of printing in Lagos. Trust me I've been there, there's money!</p>

<h4><strong>6) Video Editing/Video Production:</strong></h4>
<p>With so much content on the internet, people don't want to read for long hours. Videos are a great way to capture the attention of a target audience and keep them engaged. Mastering this skill can open doors to a wide range of opportunities, from creating YouTube content, editing ads for social media, to producing professional videos for businesses.</p>
<p>As a video editor or producer, you can offer freelance services on websites like Fiverr, Upwork, or directly to companies and influencers. Additionally, starting your own YouTube channel can be a lucrative way to monetize your video production skills. Successful video editors in Nigeria can earn upwards of 200,000 naira per project, with the potential for higher earnings when working with international clients.</p>

<h4><strong>7) Affiliate Marketing:</strong></h4>
<p>It is funny how everybody is an affiliate marketer, but only a few people consciously embrace this and earn massively from it. Affiliate marketing is simply referring people to a particular business/product and getting paid a commission for every customer you bring. It’s a low-risk, high-reward venture that doesn't require any upfront investment.</p>
<p>There are many businesses, both local and foreign, that offer affiliate programs with attractive commissions, sometimes even as high as 50%. Your success as an affiliate marketer hinges on your ability to find the right audience and effectively promote products that meet their needs. Popular affiliate programs include Amazon Associates, Jumia Affiliate, and ClickBank.</p>
<p>One significant advantage of affiliate marketing is that it saves you time, allowing you to pursue other income streams simultaneously. With dedication, you can scale this side hustle into a full-time income source, earning commissions that can vary greatly based on your network and marketing strategies.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the world is largely shifting from depending on degrees alone, and businesses are looking for individuals with skills that produce results. The internet has made it easier to work for foreign clients right from the comfort of your home, without a university degree. Most of these businesses don't care about certificates, but about how you can make them generate more profit.</p>
<p>All the skills listed above can be learned, and you do not need to have a special talent. There are many free resources online you can start with. All it takes is diligence. If you are serious enough, within 3 to 6 months you can land your first pay.</p>
<p>What to do next? Pick a skill, learn, and start earning high.</p>
