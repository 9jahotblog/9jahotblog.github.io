     <p style="color:#0000FF"> CHANGE & CORRECTION OF NAME IN NIGERIA BY MERE AFFIDAVIT
     IS NO LONGER VALID. THERE IS A NEW OR IMPROVED PROCESS. </p>
     
    <p class="lead">  Now in Nigeria, mere disposition of affidavit is not enough for a change or correction of name.


The affidavit that I know, overtime, has been 'a time and life saver' for an average Nigerian, pertaining to change of name (s).

It as a quick response to emergency. In this sense, I mean one can approach a random lawyer at anywhere and point in time, who would provide them with an affidavit, even without meeting them at the court. 

For instance, when one loses a Sim Card, certain details about the person is required, this details is contained in an affidavit. When one loses his or her Original (Birth) Certificate also, an affidavit stands as a replacement for it, in which the means of getting it is as easy and time conservative as "knowing your neighbor at where you reside, who is a lawyer."

<p style="color:#0000FF">According to the Supreme Court of Nigeria, "change and correction of names by mere affidavit is no longer valid."</p>
There is a new or improved process.

Meanwhile, the term <p style="color:#0000FF">Affidavit refers to a sworn statement in written format made especially under an oath or affirmation before an authorised officer or Magistrate.

It is a declaration of facts made in writing and sworn before a person having the authority to administer oath.</p> All affidavits are verified statements and printed on Stamp papers of different denominations. All affidavits need to be drawn up in the first person and should contain facts and not inferences.

 A person who makes an affidavit is called a Deponent or an Affiant. The person who has authority to attest a certificate may be a Magistrate who may in turn be either a Judicial or an Executive Magistrate, a Notary PublicÂ or a Commissioner of Oaths Â depending upon the affidavit which needs to be attested.Â But get a legal lawyer to guide you.

<p style="color:#0000FF">PS: An affidavit is simply a written statement confirmed by oath. It is generally used to evidence facts contained in the statement, and it is deposed to a commissioner of oaths.</p>

<p> A slite change in procedure, below are the new process to obtain an affidavit:</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Application Letter Addressed To the Chief Registrar</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF"> -Deed of Change of Name duly stamped at the stamp duty office</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Affidavit of Change of Name</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Photocopy of Call to Bar certificate, and original for citing</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Photocopy of Qualifying Certificates, and original for citing</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Birth certificate or sworn declaration of age</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Local Government Indigene Certificate</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Marriage Certificate</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Newspaper Publication</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Passport Photograph</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Verification letter from Nigerian Bar Association</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">- Letter of introduction from the Nigerian Law School</p>



<p class="lead">After all is done, the document must be notarized, signed in the presence of witnesses and the affiant must swear that the facts contained in it are true and correct before proceeding to any Civil Registry.  Meanwhile, he or she must have read thoroughly through the information contained in the affidavit before signing it, and public in any Newspaper.

It is advisable one uses the Supreme Court. The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria establishes the Supreme Court as the apex court, therefore, the prescribed filing fees are more cheaper.

This change or innovation in procedure to obtain an affidavit should be well disseminated and should not be too expensive, so the average Nigerian who does not like much stress but easy way access, may still see reason and have the convinience to follow due process.</p>

        <span>Everything that is wrong with Nigeria's economy is explained by the ongoing increase in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG/cooking gas) prices, which is why our economic managers should make a conscious effort to foster an environment of optimism. For many Nigerians, both those who live in urban areas and those in rural regions, cooking gas is beneficial and helpful for their daily needs. Nigeria is fortunate to have access to LPG, with the ninth-largest resource in the world as of 2019 (about 207 trillion standard cubic feet).......
