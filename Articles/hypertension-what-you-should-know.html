          <p><strong>Populary known</strong>  as the silent killeryp, hypertension is a condition which affects about 80 million Nigerians with about 30% general prevalence; 29.5% in men and 25% in women.</p>
          <p> According to the World Health Organisation, about 1.3 billion people in the world have hypertension. It is prevalent in 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women as of 2015. 
      In this article, I would be talking about hypertension and what everyone should know about it. 
       Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure is one of the major causes of untimely death in the world. It is a condition in which the pressure of the blood against the blood vessels is persistently high. It is a severe condition which can lead to death if not properly maintained.  </p>
          <p> Blood pressure is the force the blood exerts on the blood vessels through which it flows. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer and it is read in two forms namely: systolic and diastolic numbers. The systolic number measures the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart contracts while beating. The diastolic number on the other hand measures the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart relaxes between beats. 
         A person is said to have hypertension if on two different days the systolic pressure reading is â‰¥140mmHg and the diastolic pressure reading is â‰¥ 90mmHg.</p>
          <p> Causes of Hypertension: Hypertension is classified into two types and they are:
â€¢Primary high blood pressure. 
â€¢Secondary high blood pressure.

        Primary high blood pressure is the most common type of hypertension with a prevalence of about 90-95%. It is due to unhealthy lifestyle factors and genetic factors. 

These unhealthy lifestyle factors are: 
Excess salt intake(>5mg daily),
â€¢Obesity,
â€¢Smoking,
â€¢High alcohol intake,
â€¢Lack of exercise,
â€¢High-fat consumption,
â€¢Insulin resistance,
â€¢Unhealthy sleeping habits,
Secondary high blood pressure which is uncommon is due to specific causes such as chronic kidney disorder, diabetes, endocrine disorder and the use of birth control pills. </p>
Risks Factors of Hypertension. 
â€¢Age: The risk of coming down with high blood pressure increases as a person ages. As a person ages, blood vessels lose their elasticity and this can lead to high blood pressure. 
â€¢Race: Africans and Black Americans have a higher risk  
of developing hypertension than other races.
â€¢Gender: Men are at a higher risk of developing hypertension than women until age 64 after which women are more likely to have hypertension. 
â€¢Family history: A person is at a higher risk of developing hypertension if he/she has a family history of hypertension. 
â€¢Pregnancy: Pregnancy increases a woman's risk of coming down with hypertension. </p>
Symptoms of Hypertension.
          Hypertension is called a silent killer due to the fact that it has no prominent symptoms. However, few symptoms can be noticed in rare cases. These symptoms are:
â€¢Sweating,
â€¢Anxiety,
â€¢Sleeping problems,
â€¢Nose bleeding,
â€¢Headaches.</p>
Effects of Hypertension. 
â€¢Heart attacks and heart failure. 
â€¢Stroke,
â€¢Amputation,
â€¢Kidney failure,
â€¢Hypertensive retinopathy can lead to blindness. </p>

Prevention of Hypertension. 
          Hypertension can be prevented by reducing its risk factors. Some preventive measures are:
â€¢Engaging in Physical exercise,
â€¢Reducing salt intake,
â€¢Reducing alcohol intake,
â€¢Reducing intake of fat,
â€¢Getting enough sleep,
â€¢Reducing stress. </p>

 <p><strong>Cure of Hypertension. </strong></p>
         Hypertension is a condition that cannot be cured but can be managed by bringing the blood pressure to a healthy level. Change in lifestyle and dietary changes can help in managing hypertension. 
       <p>A common misconception about hypertension is that it affects only old people. This is completely wrong as young people can come down with hypertension too. Health practitioners advise regular blood pressure check ups to detect hypertension early. Through proper management and modification of lifestyle factors, a person can live a healthy life even with hypertension. </p>
