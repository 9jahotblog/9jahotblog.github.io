    <p style="color:#0000FF">PRICES OF STAPLES INCREASING</p>
    <p style="color:#0000FF"> By Peter Sonibare</p>
    

 Prices of staples like rice, beans, garri, that used to be easily afforded by average Nigerians have increased by a great percentage leading over 7million people in the country into poverty. 
 
Although, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the production and distribution of staples all over the country, nonetheless the prices keeps increasing drastically.

 <p style="color:#0000FF">According to UNICEF,</p> Nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children in the world with a prevalence rate of 32 percent of children under five. An estimated 2 million children in Nigeria suffer from malnutrition, but only two of every 10 children affected is currently reached treatment. Malnutrition, in addition to an increased risk of death, is linked to poor production and circulation of food in the country.

<p style="color:#0000FF">According to the selected</p> food price watch data for May 2022 released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), major consumer staples showed significant increases year on year and month on month. Y/y, all prices of the 43 food items that make up the food watch basket increased considerably.

 The price of beans, which is a major commodity and Nigeria‚Äôs¬†highest supplier of plant proteins has gone up forcing a number of families to reduce its consumption. 

 <p style="color:#0000FF">The story has</p> not been much different for rice with the staple increasing a little above 10 percentage rise in price despite the fact that a majority of our rice consumed here is locally produced as whatever rice that is allowed to be imported must do so through the ports with a tariff rate of 70 percent imposed on such imports to discourage the business while a subsisting ban hovers over the importation of rice through our borders. One wonders why despite the long run as well as the increase in rice farming in states like Kebbi, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Ekiti and Kano the much needed push in the demand for the staple has not readily provided the much needed investment in the sector as well as allow for price stability since a majority of our consumed rice is no longer subject to our exchange rates. Rice in all its variants when compared to other food items has increased moderately, from agric sold loose (+13.9% y/y) to local sold loose (+12.5% y/y), medium grained (+12.6% y/y), and imported high quality sold (+13.9% y/y). It is also safe to assume that related transport and other incidental costs may have also caused the modest increase. To a great extent, the government has been relatively successful in stimulating local rice production using incentives such as subsidized loans, cheap fertilizers, free farmland, and tax rebates.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Also, on a m/m basis,</p> save for Tomato, all food items rose considerably. In our view, the monthly increase can be associated with the impact of elevated energy prices caused by increased diesel cost, and its pass-through effect on transport costs for food items. This was reflected in the m/m increase in food inflation, which rose 2.01% m/m.

 All these have their negative effects on the lives of the Nigerian citizens. The hiked cost of foodstuffs have hampered the livelihood of most people. People can no longer afford good meals again, they eat all sorts of that unhealthy  foods thereby leading to malnourishment, and in turn gives a rise to nutrition diseases like Marasmus and kwashiorkor which are rampant in average Nigerian children.
 
<p style="color:#0000FF">Mrs David Ada'aja,</p> during a phone interview explains how things have not been easy since the increase in food prices. ‚ÄúThe prices of food in Nigeria has increased seriously, things are getting hard day by day and the government are doing nothing about it‚Äù

 However, prices of common staples, things we produce in Nigeria are now almost even more than the prices of goods we import into the country. Mrs David went further to say ‚ÄúAlthough, Boko Haram is also a factor to contributing to constant increase in food prices, take for example, beans that me and my mum used to go to Minna, Niger State to buy, we would pick whatever beans we want but because of the insecurities happening in the North, few people go to the farm they would bring whatever they see and we have no choice than to buy whether good or bad. 
 
<p style="color:#0000FF">Even garri (cassava flakes)</p> that we used to buy 16 thousand Naira per bag is now 25 thousand per bag and Palm oil that was 12 to 13 thousand Naira per 25 litre is now 17 to 18 thousand Naira per 25 litre. The government should act fast about it. It is really affecting we the common people you would see small children on the road so thin and under fed begging for money‚Äù

 Mr Samuel Ayobami a Trader who sells provision at Yaba market laments that Buhari knows the solution to the disturbing concern.
 According to him, ‚ÄúBefore, we used to sell a carton of indomie for N850, but now, we are buying it for 2,500. The loaf of bread that I used to buy at N150, now it goes for double the price due to the high cost of the flour, milk and sugar.
 
<p style="color:#0000FF">Why do I have to buy</p> a tuber of yam at N2,000 said Mr Adeyemo , who wanted to buy yam at the Anifowoshe market in somolu. He further went on to explain his ideal on how frustrated he is with the surge in food prices. ‚ÄúThis thing is getting out of hand, to feed my children three times daily is getting difficult for me. And the government are not helping issues. They are not even concerned on how we fend for ourselves despite the low minimum wage and the increase in food prices. It is really getting out of hand‚Äù.

 <p style="color:#0000FF">NBS report says</p> average price of a bottle of palm oil increased by 42.81 per cent from N593.36 in May 2021 to N847.39 in May 2022.
It also rose by 0.55 per cent on a month-on-month basis between APRIL and May.
The report showed that the average price of 1kg of boneless beef rose by 34.11 per cent on a year-on-year basis from N1,513.43 in May 2021 to N 2,029.59 in May 2022.
It added that the average price of one bottle of groundnut oil stood at N1,040.88 in May 2022, showing an increase of 47.99 per cent compared to N703.36 in May 2021.

<p style="color:#0000FF">‚ÄúOn a month-on-month basis, it rose by 3.29 per cent from N 1,007.68 in April 2022,‚Äô‚Äô</p>the NBS stated.

        <span>Everything that is wrong with Nigeria's economy is explained by the ongoing increase in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG/cooking gas) prices, which is why our economic managers should make a conscious effort to foster an environment of optimism. For many Nigerians, both those who live in urban areas and those in rural regions, cooking gas is beneficial and helpful for their daily needs. Nigeria is fortunate to have access to LPG, with the ninth-largest resource in the world as of 2019 (about 207 trillion standard cubic feet).......
