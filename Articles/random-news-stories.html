  When the Federal government declared the restrictions from schooling, working, & going out as at last year, students recanted. But the school resulted into online classes in which the students were taught by their various lecturers. Covid 19 restrictions affected them from holding a physical class & writing exams.

  Furthermore, the school resumed after various semesters has passed by & decided to promote  the students in the classes they were supposed to be. Now, the students in 300 level, are writing the exams of 100 level second semester, in which many failed & bursted into tears while others fainted & many people were withdrawn.

<p style="color:#0000FF">DR MALAFIA DIES AT GWAGWALADA, ABUJA.</p>

Former deputy governor of the central bank of Nigeria, (CBN), Dr Malafia dies this morning at  the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital Gwagwalada, Abuja. 
   As someone who relentlessly participated in the activities of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), his untimely death has dealt a deadly blow on ethnic nationalities of not only the Middle Belt but the country at large. Arising from various enquiries from Nigerians over the circumstances of his death, the Forum wishes to state as follows: That Dr Mailafia arrived Abuja last Sunday September 12, 2021 from Akure and was received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport by his wife. 
   On arrival at home, the wife noticed he was not in the best of health conditions and seemed to be suffering from malaria. After three days of treatment without signs of improvement, he went to the CBN Hospital on Friday September 17, 2021 where he was shabily treated. It took the intervention of a senior medic who immediately placed him on oxygen and admitted him. Dr Mailafia's was later given the option of choosing three hospitals: Gwagwalada Hospital, National Hospital and EHA Clinics. The wife opted for the third choice. On arrival at the EHA Clinics, the wife was subjected to yet another moment of anxiety as it took a direct order from the top management of the hospital to accept him.
    After few hours of treatment, the EHA Clinics told the wife that it was expedient to transfer the former CBN Deputy Governor to Gwagwalada as the clinic was not fully equipped to handle the case. The wife opposed the decision and insisted that she was opposed to the idea of taking her husband to Gwagwalada. Mailafia's wife only succumbed when the consultant assured her that nothing bad will happen to her husband. 
Yesterday, Saturday September 18, 2021, Dr Obadiah was transfered to Gwagwalada. on arrival, the name of the doctor that was billed to attend to Dr Mailafia was not on duty. Even when an attempt was made by foreign health consultants to save the situation, the doctor on duty got angry and said he was not obligated to listen to any foreign consultants that had been brought into the matter with the sole purpose of ensuring nothing  goes wrong.
  In this period of grief we extend our sympathy to his immediate family members and pray to the Almighty God to grant each and everyone of them the fortitude to bear the pain of this irreparable loss. The death of Dr Mailafia today represents a dark day for not only only the Middle Belt but also for all citizens  who yearn for a new dawn for justice in Nigeria.
