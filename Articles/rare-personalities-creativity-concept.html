<p>CREATIVITY By <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+2348101769399&text=Hello+Mr+Rare+I+saw+your+article+on+9jahotblog.github.ioüëè" style="color:#1DA1F2; text-decoration: none;">Mr Rare</a></p>

<p>
In this era, Man has grown into a brainbox entangled with the responsibility of meeting the thorough needs of the human race.
The constant identification of problems across all spheres of life has made innovation a fundamental constituent of life's formation regardless of time, age, and dispensations.
To this end, creativity was coined to establish the existence of problems and the need to provide answers which are, in themselves, long-lasting solutions. Innovative ideas are direct reflections of creative content combined to solve a particular problem, which may be general to all or peculiar to some.
</p>

<p>
Some of these problems hitherto, have been solved, but there are dimensions to the succor they offer; hence, various entities spring up daily, offering revised editions to the same.
Though creativity often has been attached to positive actions, it can be traced also to the other side of the coin. What it is, is what an individual calls it.
FOR ME, it is a catalyst to a good life, a good environment, amazing systems and sub-systems; the worker's manual, the Manufacturer's assistant.
</p>

<p>
Like the pen of a ready writer, the servant to a master, CREATIVITY remains a formidable tool for expertise in all facets of life, be it in good books or the reverse.
</p>

<p>CREATIVITY By <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+2348124419425&text=Hello+Omolola+I+saw+your+article+on+9jahotblog.github.ioüëè" style="color:#1DA1F2; text-decoration: none;">Omolola</a></p>

<p>
Creativity engages the mind. If you have ideas but don't work on them, you are imaginative but not creative. In order to be creative, you need to be able to view things in new ways or from a different perspective.
</p>

<p>
What is Creativity? It's the process of making an idea your own by modifying something that already exists or combining ideas together to make something satisfying.
</p>

<p>
TWO REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED TO BE CREATIVE:
<br>1. Need to solve problems
<br>2. Need to communicate ideas and values.
</p>

<p>
Creativity allows us to view and solve problems more openly and with innovation. Creativity is the ability to come up with new and exciting ideas. When students are focused on a creative goal, they become more absorbed in their learning and more driven to acquire the skills they need to accomplish it.
</p>

<p>CREATIVITY By <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+2349125247408&text=Hello+Abraham+Oluwole+I+saw+your+article+on+9jahotblog.github.ioüëè" style="color:#1DA1F2; text-decoration: none;">Abraham Oluwole</a></p>

<p>
When we talk about creativity, it always makes me understand why God is God. In that passage of the Bible, it says, "let us make man in our own image." Image! That's the word. We all are from God's perfect imagination; he imagined us into existence. I want us to understand that there's no creation without imagination.
</p>

<p>
So therefore, I'll define Creation as the imagination of nonsense into perfect sense. A very good example is us. We were created from dust. This means that anybody can pick up sand and blow it to become dust, but not everyone can pick up sand to make it dust and make it us. I'm sure you understand.
</p>

<p>
Everyone has this marvelous creative skill in them. There's no one greater than you or has the same value as you because what I can do, you can't, and what you can do, I can't! Funny right? Most of the time, you'll see a child not doing well in a particular class or subject but would beat everyone 100 to nil in another. That's not because he or she is a dullard, but because he or she has been uniquely and differently made to be better in a particular aspect.
</p>

<p>
When we talk of creativity, we most times center it to art creation, which to an extent is wrong. Creativity deals with science as well. In fact, it deals with science more because creativity deals with you being able to use your brain, mind, body, and soul at the same time to produce something perfect.
</p>

<p>
Creativity is making sense out of nonsense and using that sense to influence people's emotions. Creativity is not just an oil paint or a Mona Lisa drawing. Creativity is being able to do that thing that everyone feels they are unable to do.
</p>

<p>CREATIVITY By <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+2348089924871&text=Hello+Ayo+Oladiran+I+saw+your+article+on+9jahotblog.github.ioüëè" style="color:#1DA1F2; text-decoration: none;">Ayo (Mimi)</a></p>

<p>
Personally, I feel like creativity is a curse.
</p>

<p>
Hear me out... What's the point of being able to do something so much that it keeps you up at night, takes away your sleep, takes away quality time with friends and family, takes away your time management, and all?
</p>

<p>
Around this time in 2020, amidst a pandemic lockdown, I published a poetry Extended Readlist, and one of the poems that really was personal for me, was titled ‚ÄúCreativity, a curse.‚Äù In this poem, as a closing verse, I wrote:
‚ÄúWill I find peace in other things? 
<br>Forgetting the good ‚Äòol days with my pen
<br>Will I give in and wash it all away
<br>With a pull by my finger on the trigger‚Äù
</p>

<p>
This verse was inspired by a fellow poet who committed suicide around that time. Oh, and I think about two more happened after that.
</p>

<p>
Many creatives go through this depressing phase where everything doesn‚Äôt just make sense, and we are expected to be the ones with the sweet words that we speak to people when they are down. But who would be there for us when we have a writer's block or when the design is lacking something that we can‚Äôt just place, or when the code doesn‚Äôt make sense, or when we can‚Äôt get into character on set?
</p>

<p>
So yes, disagree with me all you want, but to me, ‚Äúcreativity is a curse of an offense which we do not know of.‚Äù
</p>

<p>CREATIVITY By <a href="https://wa.me/+2349160331432">Philip</p></a>

<p>
When we talk about creativity, it's not only about "changing the senseless to the meaningful." It's more like a battery; without a battery, your mobile can't turn on to perform various functions. Or should I say all mobiles? PCs & Tablets. Probably anything digital.
</p>

<p>
Both arts and technically, creativity is putting thoughts, feelings, and ideas that are ransacked in one's mind into not only a meaningful object or thing, but it must also be beneficial to the creator, the channel he uses to distribute his creativity, and his audience.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, most people have a negative thought about creativity, which can mean that they've been creative, but it has not been beneficial. You cannot be creative without "CRI-THINKING." You have to know what you're creating, why, the channel in distribution, and how it will be beneficial.
</p>

<p>
Do you want to write? You're not the only person writing in the whole world, but "William Shakespeare" was so popular for writing. How did he do it? What can I do to be better than him?
</p>

<p>
Creativity can come in many forms, music, dance, arts, culture, melody, name it. The lord has blessed you, yes you! & everyone of us with the power of creativity, even the bible says heaven help those who help themselves, you can create this. I know. But you have to Cri-Think, it's not for a literatee alone, but for everyone. 
   Thus, if you want to see creativity in different aspects then I suggest you study the following Icons. 
<ul>
<li>Michael Jackson (Music & Dance)</p></li>
<li>Vince McMahon   (Business)</p></li>
<li>Williams Shakespeare. (Writing / poetry / Plays)</p></li>
<li>Christiano Ronaldo   (Sports entertainment)</p></li>
<li>Hulk Hogan.   (Athletics / Wrestling) </p></li>
<li>Undertaker WWE.   (Athletics / Wrestling)</p></li>
<li>Funke Akindele. (Theatre / Acting)</p></li>
<li>Phaticusthiccy.  (Python / Coding / Software). </p></li>
<li>Broda Shaggi (Comedy).</p></li>
<li>Tiannah Empire.   (Fashion / Lifestyle)</p></li>
e.t.c. 
</ul>
   Your talent is embedded in you for a special purpose but creativity let's the talent shine, put whatever you do into a creative aspect. I believe you'll find your path...
<p>Vanity morphs to creativity after CRI-THINKING!</p>
