<p style="color:#000000">CONCEPT OF "CREATIVITY"</p>
     <p style="color:#000000">Written By Rare Personalities</p>
     <p style="color:#000000"> A group of knowledgeable individuals, a team where everyone is a team player, representing a generation of creative beings.</p>


<p style="color:#000000">CREATIVITY By <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+2348101769399&text=Hello+Mr+Rare+I+saw+your+article+on+9jahotblog.github.ioüëè">Mr Rare</p></a>

In a world of limitless possibilities and the willpower to engage innovations that are designed to make better the standard of living, _man has grown into a brainbox saddled with the responsibility of meeting the insatiable needs of the human race.

The constant identification of problems across all spheres of life, has made innovation a fundamental constituent of life's formation regardless of time, age and dispensations.

To this end, <p style="color:#000000"creativity was coined to establish the existence of problems and the need to provide answers which are in themselves, long-lasting solutions. Innovative ideas are direct reflections of creative contents combined to solve a particular problem which may be general to all or peculiar to some.</p>

Some of these problems hitherto, have been solved but there are dimensions to the succor they offer; hence, various entities spring up daily, offering revised editions to the same.

Though creativity often times has been attached to positive set of actions, it can be traced also to the other side of the coin. <p style="color:#000000"What it is, is what an individual calls it.

FOR ME, it is a catalyst to a good life, a good environment, amazing systems and sub systems; the worker's manual, the Manufacturer's assistant. 

Like the pen of a ready writer, the servant to a master, CREATIVITY remains a formidable tool for expertise in all facets of life be it in good books or the reverse.

Creativity Engages The Mind.
If you have ideas but don't work on them, you are imaginative but not creative. In order to be creative, you need to be able to view things in new ways or from a different perspective.
What is Creativity: It's the process of making an idea your own by modifying something that already exists or combining ideas together to make something satisfying.
<p style="color:#000000"TWO REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED TO BE CREATIVE.
1. Need to solve problems
2. Need to communicate ideas and values.
Creativity allows us to view and solve problems more openly and with innovation.</p> Creativity is the ability to come up with new and exciting ideas.
When students are focused on a creative goal, they become more absorbed in their learning and more driven to acquire the skills they need to accomplish it.

When we talk about creativity, It always make me understand why God is God, in that passage of the bible, it says ,"let us make man in our own "Image"
Image! That's the word, we all are from God's perfect imagination, he imagined us into existence, I want us to understand that there's no creation without imagination.
So therefore, I'll define Creation as the imagination of nonsense into prefect sense, a very good example is us, we were created from dust, they means that anybody can pick up sand and blow it to become dust, but not everyone can pick up sand to make it dust and make it us, I'm sure you understand.
Everyone has this marvelous creative skill in them, there's no one greater than you or have same value as you because what I can do, you cant, and what you can do I can't! Funny right?
Must of the times, you'll see a child not doing well in a particular class or subject but would beat everyone 100 to nill in another, that's not because he or she is a dullard, but because he or she has being being uniquely and different made to be better in a particular aspect.
When we talk of creativity, we most times cente It to art creation which to an extend is wrong.
Creativity deals with science as well, in fact it deals with science more, because creativity deals with you being able to use your brain, mind, body and soul at the same time to produce something perfect.
Creativity is making sense out of nonsense and using that sense to influence people's emotions, creativity is not just an oil paint or a monalisa drawing.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Creativity is being able to do that thing that everyone feel they are unable to do.
So when we talk about creativity, we should understand that we would have to first imagine that we are creating.</p>

<p style="color:#000000">CREATIVITY By <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+2348089924871&text=Hello+Ayo+Oladiran+I+saw+your+article+on+9jahotblog.github.ioüëè">Ayo (Mimi)</p></a>

Personally, I feel like creativity is a curse.

Hear me out...
What‚Äôs the point of being able to do something so much that it keeps you up at night, takes a way your sleep, takes away quality time with friends and family, takes away your time management and all? 

<p style="color:#000000">Around this time in 2020, amidst a pandemic lockdown, I published a poetry Extended Readlist and one of the poems that really was personal for me, was titled ‚ÄúCreativity, a curse‚Äù in this poem as a closing verse, I wrote  
‚Äú will I find peace in other things? 
Forgetting the good ‚Äòol days with my pen
Will I give in and wash it all away
With a pull by my finger on the trigger‚Äù</p>

This verse inspired by a fellow poet that committed suicide around that time. Oh and I think about two more happened after that.

Many creatives go through this depressing phase where everything doesn‚Äôt just make sense and we are expected to be the one ones with the sweet words that we speak to people when they are down but who would be there for us when we have a writers block or when the design is lacking something that we can‚Äôt just place or when the code doesn‚Äôt make sense or when we can‚Äôt get into character on set?
So yes, disagree with me all you want but to me, ‚Äú creativity is a curse of an offense which we do not know of.‚Äù</p>

<p style="color:#000000">CREATIVITY By Philip Smith</p>
 When we talk about creativity it's not only about "Changing the senseless to the meaningful".. 
   It's more like a Battery, without a battery your mobile can't turn on to perform various functions. Or should I say all mobiles?, PC's & Tablets. Probably anything digital. 
    Both Arts & Technically, Creativity is putting thoughts, feelings, ideas that are ransacked in one's mind's into not only a meaningful object or thing, but must also be beneficial to the creator, the channel he uses to distribute his Creativity, & his audience. 
    Nowadays, most people have a negative thought about creativity which can mean that they've been creative but it has not been beneficiary. You cannot be creative without "CRI-THINKING", you have to know what you're creating, why?, the channel in distribution, & how it will be beneficiary. 
do you want to write? you're not only the person writing in the whole world, but "Williams Shakespeare" was so popular for writing. How did he do it? What can I do to be better than him?  
    Creativity can come in many forms, music, dance, arts, culture, melody, name it. The lord has blessed you, yes you! & everyone of us with the power of creativity, even the bible says heaven help those who help themselves, you can create this. I know. But you have to Cri-Think, it's not for a literatee alone, but for everyone. 
   Thus, if you want to see creativity in different aspects then I suggest you study the following Icons. 
<p style="color:#000000">Michael Jackson (Music & Dance)</p>
<p style="color:#000000">Vince McMahon   (Business)</p>
<p style="color:#000000">Williams Shakespeare. (Writing)</p>
<p style="color:#000000">Christiano Ronaldo   (Sports entertainment)</p>
<p style="color:#000000">Hulk Hogan.   (Athletics / Acting) </p>
<p style="color:#000000">Undertaker WWE.   (Athletics)</p>
<p style="color:#000000">Funke Akindele. (Theatre / Acting)</p>
<p style="color:#000000">Phaticusthiccy.  (Python / Coding / Software). </p>
<p style="color:#000000">Broda Shaggi (Comedy).</p>
<p style="color:#000000">Tiannah Empire.   (Fashion / Lifestyle)</p>
e.t.c. 
   Your talent is embedded in you for a special purpose but creativity let's the talent shine, put whatever you do into a creative aspect. I believe you'll find your path...
<p style="color:#000000">Vanity emerges to creativity after CRI-THINKING!‚ô•Ô∏è</p>

        <span>Everything that is wrong with Nigeria's economy is explained by the ongoing increase in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG/cooking gas) prices, which is why our economic managers should make a conscious effort to foster an environment of optimism. For many Nigerians, both those who live in urban areas and those in rural regions, cooking gas is beneficial and helpful for their daily needs. Nigeria is fortunate to have access to LPG, with the ninth-largest resource in the world as of 2019 (about 207 trillion standard cubic feet).......
