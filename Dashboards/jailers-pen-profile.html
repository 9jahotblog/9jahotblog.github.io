 <p><strong>A NARROW ESCAPE</strong></p>
<p>


"I'm sorry sir...we lost them". The doctor said and hung up.

Fear hung Michael's throat, his Adam Apple moving up and down like cotton candy machine, "Damn! He yelled and sat on the couch and buried his face in his palms.

The previous night before the death of Michael's friends , they all went to club and enjoyed life to the fullest. When they were leaving, Micheal met a young lady at the bar who told him her sad story and explained to him that she was only at the club so that she could pay her school fees and other bills.

Michael promised to pay her well if she satisfy his sexual urge, she was left with no other choice than to follow Michael home. 

When they arrived home, Isabella was afraid but she couldn't go back anyway. She was  alone with four men in a big mansion without people knowing her whereabout.

"Babe... what's wrong? Michael asked, slightly incredulous.</p>

<p>Isabella nodded her head and followed Michael to his room upstairs. Michael's friends remained in the lounge discussing how hot the girl is, Michael heard them but he pretended as if he didn't hear.

When they got upstair, Isabella was so stunned to see how luxurious the room was, she imagined the amount she would get paid if she satisfy her client's sexual urge.

"What are you waiting for...take off your dress". Michael said.

"Okay..." Isabella nodded and began taking off her short gown, it seemed she has swallowed her fear and chewed her guilt. All that she could remember at that moment was her school fees and her landlord who is always asking her to sleep with him if she can't pay the house rent.</p>



<p>Isabella took off her dress and was left with pant and bra alone, she held the edge of the bed tightly and wrapping her lips together. "Lord please forgive me because I am about to commit a mortal sin".


"Are you talking to me?" Michael asked where he stood and he was putting on his protection and when he realized that Isabella didn't respond he whirled around. He was aroused when he saw Isabella's boobs and clear skin. "Wow! He said.


He walked slowly to her, Isabella kept her legs wrapped together and her hands tightly on the bed, her heart pounding like it would uproot from her chest. "What..." She muttered.

Michael leaned over to her, he horridly grabbed her waist and held her long brownie hair with his left hand. He started kissing her neck like a little boy licking his ice cream then he found where her nipple tape are tied together, he made her fall on her back then he removed the nipple tape.


He laid completely on her and groaning like a wounded cub. He moved his head back to hers and pictured her lips in his head, Isabella let out a soft moan and held Michael's neck. They started kissing horridly without letting out breathe out of their mouths.


After few minutes, Michael could no longer control his urge so he took the duvet and covered them both, within a blink of an eye Isabella's noise filled the whole house and Michael was sweating like a Christmas goat.

"I am in pain! Isabella cried out.
"Enough!! Michael shouted and stood up from the bed.</p>

<p>Michael took his short from the floor and wore it then he walked out of the room, Isabella covered her body with the duvet and sobbing like a spirit that descended from a river.

Michael's friends that were already eager to know how it was going jumped up when they saw Michael coming downstairs.


"Guy what's up? Billy asked.
Michael frowned his face and sat on the couch like a disappointed Mariner. He buried his face in his hand and didn't reply his friends.


"Bro, tell us the girl is hot? Drake asked excitingly.



Michael was so agitated with their questions and stood up angrily, "Look, look guys. That girl up there in my room is a virgin! He said and walked to the Tv and shook his head.</p>


<p>"She's what? They all asked in unison and laughed.

Michael frowned at them and walked to the kitchen. They all followed him and asked him if they could have the girl as well.

"What! You mean four of us will sleep with a girl? He yelled.

"No guy, we won't do it together". Billy said and exited the kitchen.


Michael was confused so he didn't know what to decide on, he just said "well...you see" and all of them ran to the lounge waiting for their turns.

After few hours, it was already 3:00am in the morning and Billy, the last person to have sex with Isabella ran downstairs half naked.

"Guys!!! He shouted and they all woke up and started asking him why he was shouting like a moron.

"Guys!! That girl...up there..argg!!! Billy stammered as tears continued rolling down his face.</p>


<p>"Listen Billy, tell us what's happening! Don said as he wiped his sweaty face.

"Okay guys... that girl in Michael's room is dead". Billy said.

"What! Dead? How? Michael asked and he was about to run upstairs when Don and Drake held him back.

"Dude, see things like this happens. Let's just dump her body somewhere". Drake said.

"Yes buddy, let's dump her it's 3:20am no one would see us. Don said and sat down.

After few minutes they all agreed to dump her body alongside with her bag. Don drove them to a quiet place where they dumped Isabella's body.

They all went back home and freshen up and immediately after the sun rose they left Michael's house. 

Immediately after they left, Michael received a call from the Western hospital that three guys had accident in a black Mercedes Benz and their conditions  was very critical. The caller even added that one of them claimed to have seen ghost on the highway when he could talk and Michael hasn't recover from the shock of the accident when the doctor called later and said they were all dead.

"The ghost" that he heard kept ringing in his head and fear gripping his soul.

Since last night Michael hasn't changed from the short he was putting on neither had he taken his bath. He was so terrified than a dog that saw a tiger.</p>



<p>He was sitting in the lounge when when he started hearing some strange laughter from the kitchen, he stood up and tiptoed to the kitchen and when he didn't see anything he decided to go back to the lounge. 

As he was about to lift his left heel then the strange laughter started again. "Please! Spare me! Michael got on his knees and begged. After few minutes the strange laughter changed to whispering.


Suddenly, the light went off and Michael crawled to the freezer. He held the handle of the freezer hoping there would be light from the freezer and immediately he opened the freezer the air that gushed out of the freezer blew him away then he hit his head on the counter. "Please...spare me!



"Spare you? The strange voice smirked.
Before Michael could know it a young lady appeared in a golden dress with a crown on her head. "Spare you? She said again.


Michael leaned up and glanced at the woman standing in front of her, "Isabella? He exclaimed.


The young woman smirked and pressed his head back with the staff in her head, "are you surprised? She asked him without expecting an answer.</p>


<p>"Aren't you dead? Micheal asked fearfully.

The young woman leaned over to Micheal who was shivering like a caught fish on the floor and rubbed his chest, "My love are you shying away from me? She smirked and caressed his chest.



"You want to know if I'm dead or not? 
Michael quickly nodded his head and avoided glances with the sexy woman in front of him.


"Yes! I am dead". She said and Michael shouted like his left eye was unplugged from its socket.

"Please..." Michael cried.

"Yes, my love I am dead, I am only here to take what belongs to me. Your friends already paid their debts. She moved more closer to Micheal.</p>




<p>"Please spare me! Michael cried.

"What belongs to me is your long and veiny penis! I won't leave without it. She thundered.



"No! No!! Micheal cried and crawled back.

She smirked at Michael and brought out a dagger from a quiver hung on her back. "See this? She showed him the dagger and licked it.




"Come here. She said in a low voice and Michael obeyed her immediately.


"Good boy, now take off that stinking short. She ordered.

Michael was shocked like a rat that swallowed a fish's bone.

"Don't get me angry now...come to mama! She said and Michael quickly moved to her.</p>



<p>Immediately he moved closer to her, she grabbed his penis and placed the dagger on his thigh.

She started rubbing his thigh and his penis while Micheal was pleading bitterly.


"Now say bye to what makes you a man and welcome a miserable life! She laughed.



Michael moved back and nodded his head, "No! No!! Don't do this! 



She grabbed Michael's neck and pressed her lips on Michael's lips...she made him fell on his back and covered his face.




When she realized Michael was not looking she took the dagger and chopped off his penis quickly.</p>




Blood gushed out from the spot and Michael was screaming like a a goat that entered into a hive of bees.




"Ugh!!! Michael shouted and jumped up from the couch where he was laying.  When he opened his eyes he saw his friends in front of him smiling, "Guy aren't you going to the club again? One of his friends asked.




<p>He looked at them and glanced at his manhood, "what are you guys doing here? He asked.



They were flabbergasted do the asked him what was he talking about.

"What are you talking about? His friends asked.


He realized everything was a dream, he didn't even let them sit and rest before he chased them out like Chihuahuas.



He went back to his room and started thanking God that everything was just a dream.</p>

            <p>MR BEN AND CHIKU</p>


<p>Mr Ben and Chiku are best of friends you could ever get jealous of, they even sleeps together sometimes.

Whenever Mr Ben goes to the market he would come back home with a lot of junks for Chiku, people would say "Chiku and Ben 5 and 6"
Ever since Chiku has been living with Mr Ben, things has been falling into places for Mr Ben, that he doesn't have to worry about what to eat.

One evening, we were all sitting outside the compound when we started hearing the sound of the dagger on the chopping wood.

"Oh my goodness!! Isn't that chiku's voice? My brother shouted and held my hand.
I was so scared and sad because Mr Ben was actually slayiñg Chiku.

My brother and I leaned over the window and saw Mr Ben cutting Chiku into pieces aggressively.

"Oh My!! I shouted and held the pillar tightly. I felt for poor Chiku who might have done a little mistake.

As Mr Ben continue cutting Chiku aggressively then the bløod splashed around his chin then he calm down a bit.</p>


<p>"I didn't expect him to be this inhumane! My brother said out loud that Mr Ben overheard and saw us peeping.


When he saw us he dropped the dagger in his hands and robbed his palm on his shirt.

The stain of bløod terrified my brother and he fainted. "What? I shouted and I couldn't run away when I realized he was coming outside.


Mr Ben came outside with a sharp knifê in his hand, he gave me a sick stare and asked me what I was doing behind his window.


I couldn't talk because I was scared of him already, then he moved an inch to me and told me not to tell anyone what I have seen.


"Every....dy..." Mr Ben quickly covered my mouth and told me not to talk.


As I was trying to talk that's when the neighbors came out from their rooms and asked what happened. Suddenly a neighbor was scared and fainted when she saw bløod on his shirt.


The neighbors asked him what happened then he looked so sad. He looked inside where Chiku's body was in pieces and his bloød splashed on the cracked wall.


"Chiku used to be my favorite and you all know" he said solemnly.

"Eh eh! We all replied in unison.

"But my mother called yesterday that she needed meat for her birthday ceremony and I couldn't provide money for her to buy meat. That's why I had to killëd Chiku my favorite.</p>


<p>"Oh what a pity. I said and all the neighborhood contributed for him to celebrate his mother's birthday.


Chiku is Mr Ben's Chicken, but he was very fond of the chicken and I don't know what else you're expecting.</p>

Immediately after the bell rang the students in the art department started taking their leave and mostly seen in two pairs... holding hands which easily portrayed that most of them are best friends.


In James College, bullies are natural phenomena. Because most of them are rich kids who thinks they could have anything.


On the hallway where students are coming in and going out, there was a boy rolling on the floor like he was been bitten by a phyton. No one dare move close to him when Clarkson was the one who knocked him down.


"Come on...get up and say that to my face again, you son of a bit*ch! He yelled and kicked the boy again.


When Clarkson had beaten the boy to stupor he allowed him to go. As the boy was about to exit the door Clarkson ran to him and pulled his ear, "Next time...you won't go home alive. He muttered and let him go.


One after another the students left the school premise and only few students were seen lurking around. Clarkson was sitting on the wooden bench with his friends when a beautiful girl walked passed them. Immediately after she has walked some feet away one of Clarkson's friend pulled him up and asked him to follow the girl.</p>


<p>"Hey! Bro...calm down" Clarkson said and rolled his eyes.

"Clark... follow this girl and talk to her now" His friend said and pushed him forward.

"Okay! Okay!! Guys...I will follow her, but pray she doesn't shout at me again today because if she does, I will break all your bones. He said and ran after the girl.


"Hey Jane! Clarkson said and grabbed the girl's butt.

Jane didn't let the second count when she gave him a thunderous slap. "Are you mad, didn't I tell you not follow around again? Idiot! She yelled and walked away.</p>


<p>Clarkson's friends saw what happened and they moved closer to him and consoled him not give up.


"Aren't you guys seeing how this babe is treating me? He yelled.


The chubby boy whom they called "piggy" laid his hands on Clark's shoulder and whispered, "You can always eat your cake and have it if your caked was baked by the devil"


They all looked at him and laughed as they walked out of the school premise.


Clark finally got home, inside the big mansion Clark was alone. His parents has gone to club again and left him a letter.</p>


<p>"Not again! He shouted and threw the letter away aggressively. After few seconds, he realized he didn't read the last line so he picked it up and read again. "BECAUSE YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A MISTAKE" YOUR MOM.


He squeezed the letter and threw it in the bin and sat on the couch, he grabbed his phone and dial an unknown number and after some minutes spoken with the person he dropped the phone and went to his room.


After few minutes, the doorbell started ringing so he came down and opened the door and to his greatest shock the delivery person was Jane.


"Oh my God, so...you sells chicken after school? He laughed.

"Listen, I'm not here for that...pay me my money and let me go. Jane said.

Clark looked at her as if he wasn't interested in having her around and told her to come in to collect the money so Jane followed.


Clark told Jane to sit on the couch while he get the money so Jane did.


After few minutes,Jane was confused what was taking him so long so she decided to check on him. She climbed the stairs and finally got to Clark's room.</p>


<p>"Hey! You came in here to take a nap while you kept me waited out there? Jane shouted.

Clark was lying like a log on the bed so Jane moved close to him, "hey! Wake up! Jane shouted.


After all her effort she realized Clark has passed out and no longer breathing, she was so scared and held the pillow tightly, she cried her eyes out.


Unexpectedly, Clark's parents walked in and saw their dead son with Jane holding a pillow.

They called the cops that Jane killed their son with a pillow.


After the trial, she was found guilty and taken to the prison. As she was sitting hopeless she glanced and saw rice and chicken in a place and beside the food was the key to the gate.

She crawled to the food, she gave the key a sick look and carried the food. She took the food and ate it.</p>


<p>Jane spent ten good years in prison. One sunny day a warder came and asked her to get out of the jail. Jane asked him why but the warder shut her up.

When she get out they explained to her that an autopsy report stated that Clark took poison and killed himself and not Jane.


Jane smirked and walked out of the scene.</p>

"Happy Deåth Day" 

I was so shocked to see these scary wishes from the man I just met.

I met him at the club where my friends forcefully dragged me too. I was introduced to him and I was told he could take good care of me because he's rich

I met him before my birthday and my friends told me he would take care of everything on my birthday, I fell in love with him because he's rich.


Early morning on my birthday he was the first person to sent me birthday wishes and when I opened the message I saw "Happy Deåth Day"


I was so terrified that I rushed out of the room and went inside the bathroom. I was shivering inside the bathroom when I heard a knock on the door outside.


I widen my eyes like they would plucked out of their sockets and wrapped my lips together, "Oh Lord...! </p>


<p>When I opened the door, I was surprised to see a delivery man who was holding a box in his arm, he grinned at me and asked if I was Becca.

"Yeaaa....I am. I responded and he handed over the box to me.


I quickly locked the door behind and threw the box on the bed, I was still standing when a text message was delivered to my phone.


I was so scared to check that I had to threw my phone away and quickly picked up the box.

I convinced myself to check the box so I opened the box and closed my eyes.


As I closed my eyes I was sweating like a Christmas goat then it dropped on my lips and I quickly opened my eyes.</p>


<p>"What the...! I shouted.

There was a gown in the box, a white gown that was socked with bløod and a head of a doll. The eyes of the doll has been chopped off and bløod was dropping from it nostrils.


"Ha!!!!! I shouted and ran into the bathroom. I sat behind the bath tub with my legs wrapped together.


No one was around and I couldn't understand the situation. Suddenly, the lights went off and the whole place looked like hell.


"Who's there? 

Before I could look around then I saw someone in front of me, he held a head of a doll with a dagger. </p>


<p>He leaned over to me and kissed my forehead, "my little chipmunk...why are you shivering? He said and stood up immediately.


"Aman? How did you get in here! I yelled.

He leaned over to me again and dragged my hair, "Shut your mouth! Why are you asking questions, you think everything is free! He yelled and hit my head on the bathtub.


Bløod started gushing out from my ears, he dragged me out and laid me on the ground.

"I thought you'd be smart and refused when your friends told you that you would pay back"
He said and smiled.</p>


<p>"Please...spare me! 
"No! You will pay the price!

He yelled and hit my head on the bathtub again.</p>

He's making out with his mom!


He was always beside me until we entered their compound, he assured me that his mother was a gentle lady who would never hurt me in anyway so I followed up.



"Frank?
"Yes baby. He looked at me and dropped his phone and car key on the center table. He started unbuttoning his shirt then his mother walked in to the lounge.



"See my baby!! His mother ran to him and hugged him so tight like she haven't seen him for the past two years. I stood there wondering if that was how Frank was brought up, he didn't even bother prostrating to his mother as a good African child should do.



"Good evening ma..." I greeted her and grinned when she ignored me. I understood it was because of the fullness of joy seeing her only son but that shouldn't be the reason why she snubbed me in a broad daylight.



When she didn't reply me then I sat on the couch and crossed my legs, within a blink of an eye Frank started caressing his mother's chin. "Baby why are you sweating this much? His mother asked and kissed him on the forehead.



It was as if my eyes were deceiving me when Frank kissed her back. I couldn't hold back anymore so I shouted. His mother gave me a sick look and asked if I was having a stroke.



"Frank? 
"Mommy you didn't even greet Lily my girlfriend" he said and stood up. </p>



<p>It was as if his mother planned to stand with him as well when she stood up and followed Frank, she started rubbing her hand on Frank's chest and apologizing for ignoring me.



If flies were invisible millions would have entered my mouth without me knowing with the way I opened my mouth like the gate of Jerusalem.



"Where on earth does a mother kiss her son on the lips for God's sake? I soliloquized.



"My dear..." She said so I quickly stood up.
"I'm sorry I didn't greet you but I was so in a hurry to feel my baby back home" she said and quickly kissed him again.



Without shame, Frank spanked her bum and held her waist like a groom who's ready to defíle his bride.</p>



<p>My legs were shaking as what was happening in front of me was like things that happens in a nightmare. 



"Mommy" he said and gave his mother a look like babies does when they needs to suck their mother's breasts.



His mother grabbed his hands and sat him on the chair then she sat on his lap and started moving up and down.



"Ha!!! I shouted and mistakenly dropped my handbag. Frank looked at me and asked if I was okay then told me not to worry because that's how his mom treats him.



I was flabbergasted that I couldn't even stand up but kept my gaze on the mother and son.</p>


<p>"Here? 
"No there"
"Right here?
"Yes! Exactly" 

Their conversation seemed like some random couple were making out and the bride was asking to be hit on the right spot.


"Abomination! I muttered.


The way his mother was moving on his laps was really freaking me out like I should hít the jug on the table on her head, "what the hëll!!


"Lily, don't worry I'll be with you shortly my mom is massaging my laps for me" he said as he was letting out soft møans.


"Frank?? I shouted as tears was already rolling down my face and washing my makeup away.


"I think she's feeling uncomfortable" she said and stood up from her son's laps.</p>

<p>"Yea mom...how about we finish this in your bedroom? He implied and held his mother's waist.



I glared like I  was just woken up from deåd and shouted, "what the f**k!!! 

"Don't worry Lily, I'll be with you shortly" Frank said and stood behind his mother.

"I just wanna scratch his back that's all" his mother said and walked out of the lounge.


Frank stopped all of a sudden and asked, "Do you wanna join us? And when I didn't reply but stood there like a log of wood he just walked like a lamb who's suffering from an eye problem behind his mother and slammed the door.</p>
