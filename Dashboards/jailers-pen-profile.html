 <p><strong>A NARROW ESCAPE</strong></p>
<p>A NARROW ESCAPE


"I'm sorry sir...we lost them". The doctor said and hung up.

Fear hung Michael's throat, his Adam Apple moving up and down like cotton candy machine, "Damn! He yelled and sat on the couch and buried his face in his palms.

The previous night before the death of Michael's friends , they all went to club and enjoyed life to the fullest. When they were leaving, Micheal met a young lady at the bar who told him her sad story and explained to him that she was only at the club so that she could pay her school fees and other bills.

Michael promised to pay her well if she satisfy his sexual urge, she was left with no other choice than to follow Michael home. 

When they arrived home, Isabella was afraid but she couldn't go back anyway. She was  alone with four men in a big mansion without people knowing her whereabout.

"Babe... what's wrong? Michael asked, slightly incredulous.

Isabella nodded her head and followed Michael to his room upstairs. Michael's friends remained in the lounge discussing how hot the girl is, Michael heard them but he pretended as if he didn't hear.

When they got upstair, Isabella was so stunned to see how luxurious the room was, she imagined the amount she would get paid if she satisfy her client's sexual urge.

"What are you waiting for...take off your dress". Michael said.

"Okay..." Isabella nodded and began taking off her short gown, it seemed she has swallowed her fear and chewed her guilt. All that she could remember at that moment was her school fees and her landlord who is always asking her to sleep with him if she can't pay the house rent.



Isabella took off her dress and was left with pant and bra alone, she held the edge of the bed tightly and wrapping her lips together. "Lord please forgive me because I am about to commit a mortal sin".


"Are you talking to me?" Michael asked where he stood and he was putting on his protection and when he realized that Isabella didn't respond he whirled around. He was aroused when he saw Isabella's boobs and clear skin. "Wow! He said.


He walked slowly to her, Isabella kept her legs wrapped together and her hands tightly on the bed, her heart pounding like it would uproot from her chest. "What..." She muttered.

Michael leaned over to her, he horridly grabbed her waist and held her long brownie hair with his left hand. He started kissing her neck like a little boy licking his ice cream then he found where her nipple tape are tied together, he made her fall on her back then he removed the nipple tape.


He laid completely on her and groaning like a wounded cub. He moved his head back to hers and pictured her lips in his head, Isabella let out a soft moan and held Michael's neck. They started kissing horridly without letting out breathe out of their mouths.


After few minutes, Michael could no longer control his urge so he took the duvet and covered them both, within a blink of an eye Isabella's noise filled the whole house and Michael was sweating like a Christmas goat.

"I am in pain! Isabella cried out.
"Enough!! Michael shouted and stood up from the bed.

Michael took his short from the floor and wore it then he walked out of the room, Isabella covered her body with the duvet and sobbing like a spirit that descended from a river.

Michael's friends that were already eager to know how it was going jumped up when they saw Michael coming downstairs.


"Guy what's up? Billy asked.
Michael frowned his face and sat on the couch like a disappointed Mariner. He buried his face in his hand and didn't reply his friends.


"Bro, tell us the girl is hot? Drake asked excitingly.



Michael was so agitated with their questions and stood up angrily, "Look, look guys. That girl up there in my room is a virgin! He said and walked to the Tv and shook his head.


"She's what? They all asked in unison and laughed.

Michael frowned at them and walked to the kitchen. They all followed him and asked him if they could have the girl as well.

"What! You mean four of us will sleep with a girl? He yelled.

"No guy, we won't do it together". Billy said and exited the kitchen.


Michael was confused so he didn't know what to decide on, he just said "well...you see" and all of them ran to the lounge waiting for their turns.

After few hours, it was already 3:00am in the morning and Billy, the last person to have sex with Isabella ran downstairs half naked.

"Guys!!! He shouted and they all woke up and started asking him why he was shouting like a moron.

"Guys!! That girl...up there..argg!!! Billy stammered as tears continued rolling down his face.


"Listen Billy, tell us what's happening! Don said as he wiped his sweaty face.

"Okay guys... that girl in Michael's room is dead". Billy said.

"What! Dead? How? Michael asked and he was about to run upstairs when Don and Drake held him back.

"Dude, see things like this happens. Let's just dump her body somewhere". Drake said.

"Yes buddy, let's dump her it's 3:20am no one would see us. Don said and sat down.

After few minutes they all agreed to dump her body alongside with her bag. Don drove them to a quiet place where they dumped Isabella's body.

They all went back home and freshen up and immediately after the sun rose they left Michael's house. 

Immediately after they left, Michael received a call from the Western hospital that three guys had accident in a black Mercedes Benz and their conditions  was very critical. The caller even added that one of them claimed to have seen ghost on the highway when he could talk and Michael hasn't recover from the shock of the accident when the doctor called later and said they were all dead.

"The ghost" that he heard kept ringing in his head and fear gripping his soul.

Since last night Michael hasn't changed from the short he was putting on neither had he taken his bath. He was so terrified than a dog that saw a tiger.



He was sitting in the lounge when when he started hearing some strange laughter from the kitchen, he stood up and tiptoed to the kitchen and when he didn't see anything he decided to go back to the lounge. 

As he was about to lift his left heel then the strange laughter started again. "Please! Spare me! Michael got on his knees and begged. After few minutes the strange laughter changed to whispering.


Suddenly, the light went off and Michael crawled to the freezer. He held the handle of the freezer hoping there would be light from the freezer and immediately he opened the freezer the air that gushed out of the freezer blew him away then he hit his head on the counter. "Please...spare me!



"Spare you? The strange voice smirked.
Before Michael could know it a young lady appeared in a golden dress with a crown on her head. "Spare you? She said again.


Michael leaned up and glanced at the woman standing in front of her, "Isabella? He exclaimed.


The young woman smirked and pressed his head back with the staff in her head, "are you surprised? She asked him without expecting an answer.


"Aren't you dead? Micheal asked fearfully.

The young woman leaned over to Micheal who was shivering like a caught fish on the floor and rubbed his chest, "My love are you shying away from me? She smirked and caressed his chest.



"You want to know if I'm dead or not? 
Michael quickly nodded his head and avoided glances with the sexy woman in front of him.


"Yes! I am dead". She said and Michael shouted like his left eye was unplugged from its socket.

"Please..." Michael cried.

"Yes, my love I am dead, I am only here to take what belongs to me. Your friends already paid their debts. She moved more closer to Micheal.




"Please spare me! Michael cried.

"What belongs to me is your long and veiny penis! I won't leave without it. She thundered.



"No! No!! Micheal cried and crawled back.

She smirked at Michael and brought out a dagger from a quiver hung on her back. "See this? She showed him the dagger and licked it.




"Come here. She said in a low voice and Michael obeyed her immediately.


"Good boy, now take off that stinking short. She ordered.

Michael was shocked like a rat that swallowed a fish's bone.

"Don't get me angry now...come to mama! She said and Michael quickly moved to her.



Immediately he moved closer to her, she grabbed his penis and placed the dagger on his thigh.

She started rubbing his thigh and his penis while Micheal was pleading bitterly.


"Now say bye to what makes you a man and welcome a miserable life! She laughed.



Michael moved back and nodded his head, "No! No!! Don't do this! 



She grabbed Michael's neck and pressed her lips on Michael's lips...she made him fell on his back and covered his face.




When she realized Michael was not looking she took the dagger and chopped off his penis quickly.




Blood gushed out from the spot and Michael was screaming like a a goat that entered into a hive of bees.




"Ugh!!! Michael shouted and jumped up from the couch where he was laying.  When he opened his eyes he saw his friends in front of him smiling, "Guy aren't you going to the club again? One of his friends asked.




He looked at them and glanced at his manhood, "what are you guys doing here? He asked.



They were flabbergasted do the asked him what was he talking about.

"What are you talking about? His friends asked.


He realized everything was a dream, he didn't even let them sit and rest before he chased them out like Chihuahuas.



He went back to his room and started thanking God that everything was just a dream.
