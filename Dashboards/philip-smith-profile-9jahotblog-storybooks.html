 <p><strong>The tale of Jacqueline Kennedy</strong></p>
Julius Parker was one of the wealthiest man on planet earth, he earned multiple degrees in college & universities and he.... <strong>What? Why are you cutting me of? Let me speak.</strong>

Me? As for me I am hopeless, there is no zeal in me to read, write, or work. Why will I do that? 

  No stop it! Head, I wasn't talking to you, I'm just saying. .... Umm? What?.... Why will I talk about J parker? He's my role model of course. You're asking me why? 

Because he was mentally ill just like I am, & he got over it, from what I've heard, it is such a blessing, how lucky he is. 

Why? Where are we going? No, no, leg! Stop it, I'm not going anywhere with you! I'll cut you off.. <strong>*Picks a pen knife*</strong>

The last time I got up from this bed I was embarrassed, can you just imagine? How can I lie about that? 
Sane people are so dramatic, they are the same people who will say <strong>"he should have told someone about it, or asked for money, I would've helped.... Now he's dead, such a pity".</strong>

And if I tell anyone my problems, they will say <strong>shut up! You're just looking for attention!</strong>


Ouch!! What was that for? Why would you slap me? Hehe! You think I can't do it? I know I'll be hurt, but you'll be hurt as well... That's it! I'm tying you down! Stupid hands! 

Where was I? 

<strong>Jacqueline!!</strong>

Yes mum! 

<strong>How are.....oh my god? Why did you tie yourself up?</strong>

Don't mind Mr hand, he is so foolish, he slapped me while I was speaking.. 
No no... Mum! Stop it, don't untie me.... Ah .... Mum.....üò≠üò≠üò≠

Sorry about that lads, my name is Jacqueline Kennedy, I am sane, I guess. Hahahahaha! 
   Yeah so, not very much to say about myself, shut up brain! 
   So yeah, there's this demon in my sleep, I don't believe it's sleep paralysis though, it is real! Sane people lie. He doesn't allow me sleep. 

The last time I closed my eyes, he quickly poured petrol all over my body! & He lightened the whole place, I was in pain, what's the essence of sleeping? Did I offend anyone? I opened my eyes to see my room getting burnt, I quickly rushed to the bathroom, carried a bucket of water, & started quenching the fire. 

Then the sane people rushed in, & gave me a tight slap on the face!! 
<strong>Where did you see fire?, You this idiot, get out!!!</strong>

I wonder why they are so blind, anyways, later in the evening I went to the forest as usual, to sit & look at the sky till noon, hoping to see a shooting star so I could wish for something..

This night was the best night of my life, I saw a shooting star, & I wished to know the demon in my sleep, who doesn't allow me to close my eyes, ever since I was born. 

Quickly, Mr brain informed me to buy poison, & add a lot of it to my food, If I can't sleep in this world, why can't I sleep in death? & He also promised me, the demon will be known to me..

I agreed, set up a camera, covered my bed with a white bedsheet, opened the windows for the first time in my life, & I ate poison to my fill. 

I slept, naked & covered myself with a green blanket, I felt pains, & I asked my brain why he didn't inform me about it...

Before I could know it, I had already slept off, I have never slept like this in my whole life, 5 minutes passed, 10 minutes passed, hours passed, & no demon came. 

I was so happy, I wish I could tell the sane people about this, each moment I felt with sleep was wonderful, I never knew sleep was this sweet. 

Angels kept calling, *come my child*, I told them to wait, I choose sleep over heaven. 

Angel Philip appeared, & showed me the capture of the camera I set before I took the poison, I saw myself, my hands, in many places, trying to stop me from sleep, but couldn't, it even held a timeframe, telling me to come back to life. I couldn't, *was I dead?* I asked. 

"Yes"-- Angel Philip said.
So I am the demon in my sleep paralysis? -- I asked.

<strong>"It is the mirror, you will be aware, Jacqueline, when you arrive in heaven"</strong>-- He responded again. 

 So this is the meaning of death? I get to sleep? I am no longer awakening, & I requested for angel Philip to depart.

This image must reach & circulate the whole planet, whoever thinks death is negative, or is afraid of death, should look at this picture well, & make out my story out of it... I am so happy, for the first time in my life, I closed my eyes, & slept. </p>

            <p>"What is your problem? who the hell is Jaden again??" -- Sparkles said. 

<p>"Jaden is my friend, oh my god! why are you like this? Don't you dare say you don't know him! Because I always post our chats, his photographs, & everything about us actually before I even met you"-- Paris responded.</p>

<p>She left his place angrily & posted a crying, angry & fed up "What is on her social media stories. 

The first viewer appeared to be Jaden, her male best friend, he asked what the problem is claiming he does not like to see her sad. She told him how she felt due to his eagerness so he could leave her alone.</p>

Still he didn't, he asked to come & see her immediately, she said she was around his area, as to why her boyfriend house is close to the place as well. 

She payed a visit to her friend, sobbing at the corridor & whispered "May I come in?" ....
"yes please..."-- Jaden said with a tensed face..
So what happened??  </p>

"Nothing"-- she responded. 

<p>"Oh please, nothing happened?? & you're looking like this? Come on, this is what I don't like about you, share your pain with me dearest. Please, I beg you.." -- He said with a more tensed face..

"Okay baby, I don't like to see you sad as well, now look, you're already sweating. 
The thing is I don't know what is wrong with Shegz nowadays, he complains about almost everything. But I can't take it whenever he speaks ill about you, it hurts me to my spine." -- Paris </p>

<p>"I hope I'm not causing a rift between you & your so called boyfriend? You told me about him late! So face whatever he does to you. I was the one who should've had you, to be honest, I was quite mad when you told me you've been with him for some months now, oh gosh!" -- Jaden.</p>

<p>"Shut up, hahaha, naughty boy! you've started with your jokes, but honestly I don't like it when he says don't talk to Jaden anymore, even your girlfriend cannot say she met you before I did, hahaha..." </p>

<p>"Awwwwn, look at how cute you are, this is how you should be, smile my love. Continue smiling" -- Jaden. </p>

<p>"Jay, no one treats me the way you do, why isn't Shegz like you? 
Even when you scold me at times, I still feel loved. 
Do you know how many things he complained about me? </p>

<p>He said, "I don't like your rings, if I got it for you then you can wear them, throw these ones away.

I don't like your dress sense, are you a lesbian? Be more corporate, can't you see other guy's girlfriends??</p>

<p>Jaden is not your friend avoid him!!! 

Kump is not a good girl avoid her as well.</p>

<p>I don't like your lip stick change it, can't you wear lipsticks of my favorite color?

I don't like how you relate with guys stop it, it's too embarrassing, stop sharing hugs up & down, are you a minister of hugs? I'm supposed to have all of you completely, not them.</p>

<p>Stop posting your pictures too much, it will make those n!ggas feel you're not taken.

Stop chatting on groups too much, it hurts me!" </p>

<p>He is a complete failure!!!!

"Hehe, heha, hehahahahaha, calm down Paris..."</p>

<p>"What's so funny? I'm serious... hahaha."</p>

<strong>*Draws him closer*</strong>

<p>"What do you think of yourself young man..?"

Unbuttoning his shirt, while he remains clueless what she is up to, using her sharp finger nails to caress him from the chest, down to his six pack, unveiling sexual stimulation.</p>

<p>He grabs a hold of her ass, & kisses her deeply, his lips on her lips slowly, her lips on his lips, interchanging from time to time. 

She takes of his belt in this process, zips down his trousers & feels a long pen crafted entity, removing every single bounded clothing on his body, the kiss becomes more aggressive. As she touches his phallus, their bodies attract more stimulation, she kisses him more deeply, tongue to tongue, ignoring the sputum being swallowed. </p>

<p>She manually caress his genital organ while the kiss gets more & more excessive. He returns the favor by ripping of her piece of clothing with the power coming from immense desire, he places her on the bed, & grips his phallus, inserting it into her moist canal tract, it gets blocked by her hand.

"Wait, we shouldn't be doing this....." -- She said. </p>

<p>"I know, but I love you very much."-- He responded. 

He inserts it again, each time he does that, something always feels to be guarding there, just like a gate, he was getting impatient, he angrily pushed it forward & the gates blocking his earlier insertion, was crushed. Blood gushes out of the lower part of her reproductive organ while she screams "Arrrrrrrhhh". "Are you a Virgin", -- he asked. </p>
She responded yes. 
<p>With her metaphysical windows wide open & her eyeballs rolls up. She grabs the bedsheet tight, moaning. 

He keeps pushing in & out on the same track, until it gets more pleasuring, Instantaneously! It goes in & out with extra moans from her caressing his back as an indication of a job well done.
It got faster! & more painful when it extended from the two inner folds of the vulvar, she screams louder! It reaches more deep into the muscular organ in her pelvic cavity, she moans louder. </p>
<p style="color:#0000FF"> PART 2</p>
<p>He releases a set of cells, into her v!gina.  

Making them both satisfied. </p>
<p>He jumps on the other side of the bed, with a huge sigh all sweaty & having back pains. 

She tries getting up, but something draws her back, & that is pain, she turns on the air conditioner & open her legs wide in front of it, so it could suppress the pain & hotness she was feeling under. </p>

<p>A sudden profuse knocking on the door got their bones shaking, as they dressed & hurried outside.

'Look at her! shameless woman.' -- The crowd assembled in front of Jaden's apartment said. </p>

<p>It was her imagination, her conscience, all wrapped up as bunch of people, judging her character, sleeping with her best friend, instead of her boyfriend. She held Jaden's hand tight & said... 'Please, will you support me? We're in a relationship now, I need you, I can't face Shegz alone... Follow me to approach him & tell him I'm done!'...

Quickly! Jaden ran so fast, entered his car & departed like he just got away from the prison cell. She was surprised, her mind was asking a lot of questions, did he use me?, she was heartbroken, the people already started picking stones to throw at her, a man bumped in from the crowd & hugged her. 

'Carky, you?....' -- she asked.
Carky was an old time friend, who had intentions towards her body sometime ago. He proclaimed he was there to help,  held her hand & gave her a tight hug, with soothing promises to keep her happy & stay with her. He addressed the crowd that he is now in charge, & he is not a coward like Jaden, he will face them, & he will face Shegz. </p>

<p>She escorted Carky back to Jaden's room, she was lost in her thoughts, all she could know is that she's helpless, & he helped her in times of lull & stood by her, through her heartbreak. 

He wiped her tears off & laid her down, & they both recreated what she had just finished with Jaden.. When they were done, he dressed up & was about to leave, she ran to his back quickly & asked why he was leaving without her. 'I am done bro, I've had my way, you're so sweet, & naive, women! haha'... --He said. </p>

<p>"WHAT??!!" Jaden shouted as he dropped the bouquets of flowers in his palm amongst the crowd, & looked straight into her eyes..  'Why did you do this???' ..

'You left me, you jerk! I have found a better person, did you know what I had to go through? within those times you left me, I was almost stoned to death. I am having white hairs now, what took you so long? By the way, I thought you left, what's with the flowers?'. </p>

<p>"Eh? Cut! cut! cut! who is the better person? Me I'm just here to sleep with you, if you'll excuse me I have wife & children at home to take care of, thanks for the copulation, it was spectacular! I was waiting for the right time since...." -- Carky said. 

"So you used me"? -- She asked, sobbing. </p>

<p>Jaden was speechless watching Carky go, & seeing Paris miserable, he kept asking himself how she could have allowed another man into her life while he gathered a priest, bouquet of flowers, his parents, Paris parents were present as well, he wanted to wed her in front of those crowd that were judging her & wanted to stone her. In his absence, someone came into her life for a particular motive & she fell for it. 

Paris was totally embarrassed. </p>

<p>"Daughter, do you think everyone becomes so nice all of a sudden if they are not getting something from you? where was Carky when Jaden was taking his time to make you happy under Shegz's nose?, where was he then? I hope you have learnt your lesson." --Paris mum said. </p>

Light fades.
