 <p><strong>SHEü¶ã</strong></p>
<p>
She is ruined and damaged
She is broken and down
Her innocence was taken away from her
Way way before a very long time.</p>

<p>She used to be the happiest of them all
She used to have the biggest and brightest smile
She used to have a heart of gold,
that nothing could stain.</p>

<p>She noticed though
that all of a sudden
everything went crashing down.</p>

<p>She got to understand death
and the evil of life at a very young age.
And those who were meant to be there,
to hold her and make sure
the shits of life wouldn't have an effect on her,
either died or left her behind.</p>

<p>She didn't know or understand what was happening
until she no longer felt happy.
The things that used to get her all excited
couldn't even strike the tinniest of chord in get
and the things that made her feel on fire,
no longer caused as little as sparks I'm her.
And just like that,
giving out a smile became one of the hardest thing for her.
Though she still smiles,
yes, she smiles a lot to cover up that pain and darkness.
But that genuine and innocent smile,
became a stranger to her.</p>

<p>She's really trying to find an explanation to what went wrong
Why her big soft heart became an hard stone
Why she no longer cares about anything or anyone
Why instead of happy and positive thoughts,
sad, negative thoughts are all she can think of.
Why she destroys the little good things around her
cause she's ready for it be ruined.</p>

<p>She doesn't like this though,
she wishes with everything in her
something or someone
could bring back the old her.</p>

<p>The question isn't 
"Does God speak?"
The question is 
"Are you patient enough to listen?"</p>

<p>He doesn't shout or yell
or go around with canes before He talks
He whispers..... His voice is calm and solemn
but still very loud.</p>

<p>You definitely wouldn't hear Him
if your mind has strayed away
You definitely wouldn't hear Him
if you weren't calm enough.</p>

<p>Not just to Pastors, not just to Prophets or Parents
He speaks to everyone,
both young and old.</p>

Put yourself together,
calm yourself down.
Let your Spirit be in tune with His
and listen to what
the Father has to tell you.

   <p> If this had happened ten years ago, I'd have stood up to sing Taylor swift's "Speak Now".
 
   "He's finally married". Charles, my husband whispered in my ears as he used his middle finger to tuck my hair behind my ears.

  "Of course he is" I smiled back at him and focused my attention back on my best friend who looked happy getting married to his high school girlfriend.

   His eyes found mine and we both smiled and made funny faces to each other. When he liked back to Amelia, who looked like a princess as always, I couldn't help but think about how I always dreamt that will be me. Well......... until Charles came into the picture.</p>
   ********************************************
<p>"Hey Bestie". Alex kissed my cheek from behind, in the library where I was struggling to complete my assignment and figure out a topic for Mrs. Reynolds to talk to the grade two about.

 *BESTIE* that's what Alex calls me almost all the time, maybe so I could let it sink in my head that that was all we were..."Best Friends" nothing more, nothing less. But you know, I might as well say this, that's just simply what I am to Alex and not him to me... Yes, I don't see Alex as just my best friend, Alex has been the only guy I've loved in all my life.</p>

   "Hi Alex" I took off my glasses and headphones knowing fully well work was done. 
Now I see why students were happy when they found out Miss Sandy was absent today. The library is open for everyone and no one would complain of noise today.

<p>"You look tired". Alex used his white handkerchief to wipe the sweat dots on my face. "Tough work?" he put the handkerchief back to his pocket.

   Every work is a tough work once it's from Mrs. Reynolds,". I honestly replied.

  "What did she ask you to do this time?"

  "Well apparently, second grade has a talk show on Friday and she needs me to help her come up with something. She claims she doesn't want to bore them by sounding old". Even though we all know she's old. I completed in my mind.</p>

   "I guess that's what happens when you're your Aunt's favorite student". Alex wore a smug smirk and I just groaned in response.

 <p> "I don't mean to sound rude but I really hate it" 

  "Her being your Aunt or you being her favorite student?"</p>

<p>"Both. I'm Mr. John's favorite student too and he also makes me do extra work. I just want to be a normal student, I don't even want anyone to know my name". I'm sure I sounded so frustrated but trust me, you also will if you were in my shoes.

   "Just in case you haven't noticed Sugar, there's no normal student in our high school". Alex wasn't teasing me, even I know it was true. "You're either famous for being an athlete or a football and basketball player or for being a cheerleader, or being that boring nerd that's the bully's favorite toy or just like in your case, for being a nerd who has a family working in the school and is loved by all teachers".</p>

  "But I don't want that". I cut Alex from saying whatever else he had to say. I didn't sign up for all these.

  "It wasn't and still isn't up for a debate Jenna.... that's just how it works here".

<p>The silence that followed was quick and very needed. I took a deep breath and packed my bag.
  Alex frustrated sigh was what made me stop what I was doing.</p>

 "You OK?"

   "I've never been Ok since I started dating her"

  "Amelia?"

 <p>I was answered by Alex 'duh?' face. Even I knew that was a stupid question. Who else was he dating.

  "Just break up with her Al. I hold nothing against her but if she stresses you that much, you should seek your mental peace by ending it". And not take it up again. I said that last sentence in my head... but truly, they've broken up and come back together like what? twenty times...</p>

 <p> "I can't Jenna.. it isn't easy.. she's a whole lot to handle but she needs me so much. All her life, she never had anyone to stick up to and she finally has me, I've made promises I don't want to break. And I love her"

  *CRACK! CRACK!! CRACK!!!* that was my heart break. For a lot of reasons, I say.</p>

  Yeah true, I know Amelia is a lot to handle. I know that because she was once my best friend. I and Amelia were once inseparable, everyone knew we were best friends but everything changed two years ago when she joined the cheerleaders and became the captain. At first, she still hanged out with me and begged me to join her but knowing fully well I wouldn't, I guess she got tired and got herself new friends to maintain that new socal life she just got.

<p>That was the beginning of our issues but it became worst when I found out she had a crush on Alex. She alone knew about my feelings for him and so I think her falling in love with him was just to hurt me. She broke our friendship and decided to break my heart. As a cheerleader, she was mostly always with Alex since he was the captain of the football team. Now try imagining how I always feel when I do watch my best friend in the field and see my ex best friend stare at him with love.</p>

Cut story short, I felt and still do feel like Taylor swift when she sang "You Belong To Me" because though I am Alex's best friend and i love him, fine, he loves me in the best way possible, but he still loves someone else in another way and isn't trying to hide it. I should be the one he should be in love with... I'm the one who knows him, his family, his favorite song, drink, food, colour, I know his dreams and fears... I know everything about him. And kill me, I'm always the one he comes crying to whenever he and Amelia breaks up.

"She's calling" Alex rose to his feet staring at his phone. "we'll see later. Don't go home without me, I'm dropping you off remember?" I nodded my head like the faithful dog I was 

 <p> "Good. love you" he kissed my forehead and disappeared.
 ***********************************************

  "I never believed he was going to end up with Amelia". Charles had his both hands on the steering wheel, driving us home 

  "I know right. They could never had been together for two months without breaking up"</p>

  "Exactly. I always thought if my little brother was going to end up with someone, it was going to be.... never mind" "So what should we do tonight?" Charles sounded so desperate to change the topic. He shouldn't have brought it up in the first place and he knows.

<p>"I love you hunny but I'm sure you didn't just tell me 'never mind'" I imitated him. One of the funny common things between my husband and I was that, neither of us will ever let a 'never mind' slide.

   "Aaarghh fine" now my thirty one years old husband was acting more childish than our baby girl "I always just thought Alex would have ended up getting married to you". Charles threw a scared look my way before returning his gaze back to the road.</p>

   "Me?"

   "Yeah. With the way he always got into a fight with me whenever I spoke about my feelings for you, if i was a bet person, I'd have bet odds you were getting married" he laughed. "And I know you also let that  thought in your head a lot of times" his smile faded away and I couldn't tell if he was joking or his insecurities were back.

<p>  I sighed and turned to the back to carry up Nora, our toddler so has been listening attentively -i believe- to our conversation which Charles just looked at me from the mirror.

   "I'm not going to deny the fact that I once loved Alex. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it but then, he was a lost course, I knew I could never have had and who cries over a bottle of milk when you have whole pizza and a bucket of ice cream with you". Nora's whines interrupted me and I and Charles laughed. "Well, except Nora" I continued.</p>

 <p>"Whatever happened was way before I fell in love with you. I don't know how I didn't realize it before, you know, during the whole time I was chasing something that wasn't mine but I don't care honey. Look, I love you, I love Nora, I love us, I love our family and trust me, the moment you came into the picture, you won my whole heart.... I never was one that could do two things at once, I gave you my love and gave it all to you. I know you still do feel somehow but believe me when I say, I'll never trade what I have with what doesn't belong to me. I belong to you and you Belong to me". 

  I ended my speech and Charles surprised me by parking the car in the garage I didn't know we've reached and kissed me.</p>

  The kiss though was rushed, was full of love and passion. We didn't speak a word, the only thing that could be heard was Nora giggles.

<p>"Hmmm..." The king let out a sigh and held the letter in his left hand.


"Your Majesty! Her Royal Highness is here" The commander said without looking at the King on the throne, he bowed still and wondering what was taking the king so long to order the queen's entry.</p>



"Your Maj...
"Let her in." The king said a low voice.


The gate was open and the sun reflected in the royal palace, the king was stunned when he glanced at the queen from afar.  Her emerald ball gown was like that of a goddess, the temple jewelry on her right hand was making a rhythm that the king's heart was dancing to.


<p>The king couldn't look away from her since she has been walking graciously on the tiled ground.


The King couldn't control his thought anymore, he was lost. The images of the queen started appearing in his head, how he met her before he became the king and how much they both loved each other. All these memories was flying in his head while the queen was bowing to him without getting reply.


The queen, who was already aware of how surprising the king could be whenever she dresses like a goddess bowed still as smiles was escaping her soft pink lips.</p>



"Her Royal Highness is here..." The commander said in a sense of letting the king realize how lost he was.

"Greetings, Your Majesty." The queen smiled and walked up to the king on his throne.


<p>The king quickly stood up and held her hand, "You look like a god...goddess!" He smiled and walked her to her sit.



The king stared at the commander and he left immediately, "what brought you here in a sunny day without a guard, have you forgotten you're carrying the future of this kingdom? He said and allowed her sit on his laps.


"Your Majesty." She called and looked into his eyes, she caressed his jaw and rubbed her hand down to his chest.

Just as she was taking her hand down to his belly the king grabbed her hand back to his chest and grabbed her waist with the other hand. "You look so tense." The king said with an arched brow.</p>


She looked confused, there were many questions written in her heart but she didn't know which one to ask. She was in a great confusion, the king pulled her closer and kissed her lips. She didn't let go of him, she held him tight like a toddler and shut her eyes.


There she was moving her head from left to right and licking his lips like a sweet.



<p>After few minutes of intensive kissing the countenance of the slaves started hunting her sight and she was no longer at ease. 

The king was worried so he asked her if he needed to summon a physician, "No, Your Majesty. I'm alright. She said and pulled away from him.

"What's wrong my Queen, tell me." He raised his brows.

"I have a favor to ask you my Lord." She muttered under her breathe in a way that the king could heard.</p>


"What is it? He asked and kissed her belly.
"If you can free the slaves, I'll give you a son. Your heir! She said as tears welled in her eyes.


The king let go of her and looked away, he knew she would ask something about the ungrateful slaves who betrayed their own kingdom. But he couldn't say no anyways she was the apple of his eye.


<p>"Please, My Lord! She got on her knees and begged.
The king stared at her and helped her up, he hugged her tightly and caressed her long hair.
"It's done! He said and let go of her.


"Thank you My Lord! She smiled and kissed him on the lips.

The king sat on the throne and took a letter that was hung beside him, he was reading the letter when the queen said she needed to confess something.</p>

"Go ahead." The king said without looking at her.
"I'm carrying...your twins." She said and quickly avoided glances with the King.

The king glared at her and squeezed the letter in his hand, "what? He said and stood up.

<p>The queen rolled her eyes and bit her lower lip, she wouldn't dare touch him at that moment she just sat on her seat and twisting her hand.

"I see you're not happy about this..." She said.


"Why not? I'm extremely happy. But for the meantime you'll be escorted to your father's quarter in the northern part of the kingdom and deliver there then after the delivery you may come back to the palace.</p>


For a while the queen's heart stopped beating, her eyes were rolling like they would be plucked out of their sockets, "Your Majesty? She called in a soft tone.


"Is there any problem with that? The king asked and sat back on the throne.


<p>The queen started smiling like a new wedded bride and held the king's hand, "My Lord, I was only pulling your leg. I'm carrying your heir! She laughed and laid her head on his chest.


She could heard his heart accelerating, "The diviner said I'm Carrying your heir." She smiled.

"It's fine now, you must be tired." He said and kissed her forehead.

"Yes Your majesty." She said and stood up.</p>

The king called the guards to escort her back to her quarter and they walked her out immediately.

As soon as the queen got outside the royal palace a young lady who was alluring and seemed more like a bodyguard came with an umbrella. "Your Highness, she bowed and told the guards to head back because the queen doesn't want any disturbance.

The guards left immediately, "Your Highness, is everything alright? She asked.

The queen looked at her and tears rolled down her face, "Jun Tao...I almost made His majesty believed that I'm carrying twins." She said and stopped walking.

<p"Were you able to convinced him that you're carrying the heir? Jun Tao asked.
"Yes, I lied! The queen cried.

Jun Tao held her arms and told her not to worry so they continued walking.

"It's an abomination for an heir to share womb with a girl, if His majesty later know that I'm carrying the twins he might not spare the princess" The queen smirked.</p>


When some palace maids passed by them they stopped talking for a while and continued when the maids had left.


"I must keep it a secret, I must protect this child! She yelled and rolled her eyes.</p>
