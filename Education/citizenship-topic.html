<p style="color:#0000FF">unit1: What is Citizenship?</p>
  Citizenship is the juristic and political status in which an individual is granted full legally sanctioned membership in a state, & owes allegiance to it. 
   Citizenship is the status accorded to an individual for being a citizen of a particular community state or country. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">unit2: Who is a citizen?</p> A citizen is a legal member of a sovereign State who enjoys rights entitled to him. Especially civil and political rights. 
   A citizen is a member of any given political community who enjoys full political, social & economic rights. This enjoyment of rights differentiates him/her from an alien. 
    While an alien is a foreigner who resides in any country of his choice and enjoys all rights except contesting for political office or voting in elections.. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">unit3: How can citizenship be acquired??</p>
According to the 1999 Nigerian constitution, citizenship can be acquired in the following ways..


			 <div class="footer_box">
			  <div class="col_1_of_3 span_1_of_3">
					
					<ul class="first">
					<li><p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Birth</li></p>
						<li>  <p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Registration</li></p>
					  <li>  <p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Honour</li></p>
               <li>  <p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Naturalization</li></p>
               <li>  <p style="color:#0000FF"> Citizenship by Conquest </li></p>
                <li>  <p style="color:#0000FF"> Citizenship by Unification</li></p>
            </ul>
.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Birth:</p> 
An individual can claim citizenship by Birth of the place where he was born. 
   If a person was born in the UK by Nigerian parents, that child can claim UK citizenship.
Meanwhile, there's what we call "JUS SOLI" which is a birthright, it entails that a person born in a place of nationality is automatically a citizen by blood. 
   JUS SANGUINUS: Says a person can acquire citizenship of his blood parents, if a Nigerian parent gives birth to you in another Country, you are definitely a Nigerian citizen. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Registration: </p>
  This is acquired when a person is married to a citizen of another country and the marriage passes legal process. It is easier for an alien woman who married a Nigerian man to acquire citizenship. Also, if a Nigerian man marries a female US citizen, he can claim the United States citizenship after passing legal processes & completing his papers. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Honour:</p>
   This occurs when an individual is bestowed the citizenship of another country as a result of his flawless contributions either to the growth of development of the country. 
    It happens without passing through  procedures like the others. 
 Example is President Emmanuel Macron of France. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Naturalization: </p>
   This type of citizenship is acquired when an alien has lived in a particular country for at least 15 years (Uninterruptedly).
   He also has to be of good character with no criminal records, must be full of age, must have contributed somehow to the development of where he resides in the country or the state. 
    He must also swear on an oath of allegiance. (The country expects something from you, as you also expect something from the country).. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">Citizenship by Conquest: </p>
   This is acquired by struggles, conquering a State, dominating it, making the breeds of the conquered State speak your language. 
The South Sudanese people gained their independence from Sudan in July 14, 2011. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">Obligations of a Citizen</p>
<div class="footer_box">
			  <div class="col_1_of_3 span_1_of_3">
					<ul class="first">
					<li><p style="color:#0000FF">A citizen must respect any National symbols, including the National pledge and National anthem.</li></p>
						<li><p style="color:#0000FF">He must respect the rights of others citizens. </li></p>
					  <li><p style="color:#0000FF">He must respect authority and the law. </li></p>
               <li><p style="color:#0000FF">He must vote during elections. </li></p>
               <li><p style="color:#0000FF"> He must be loyal to his country.  </li></p>
                <li><p style="color:#0000FF"> He must pay his taxes regularly. </li></p>
                <li><p style="color:#0000FF"> He must be ready to defend his country during war..</li></p>
            </ul>

<p style="color:#0000FF">Differences Between a Citizen and an Alien.</p>
 <div class="footer_box">
			  <div class="col_1_of_3 span_1_of_3">
					
					<ul class="first">
					<li><p style="color:#0000FF">A citizen is allowed to vote & be voted for, an alien cannot. </li></p>
						<li><p style="color:#0000FF">A citizen can be sent represent his country in international matters. </li></p>
					  <li><p style="color:#0000FF">A Citizen can join the Army, Police e.t.c, an alien cannot. </li></p>
               <li><p style="color:#0000FF">An alien can be deported, a citizen cannot be deported. </li></p>
               <li><p style="color:#0000FF"> A citizen enjoys civil & political rights, an alien does not.  </li></p>
            </ul>


<p style="color:#0000FF">Rights Enjoyed by a Citizen.</p>

<div class="footer_box">
			  <div class="col_1_of_3 span_1_of_3">
					<ul class="first">
					<li><p style="color:#0000FF">Right to peaceful assembly & association. </li></p>
						<li><p style="color:#0000FF">Right to life. </li></p>
					  <li><p style="color:#0000FF">Right to Freedom of expression. </li></p>
               <li><p style="color:#0000FF">Right to freedom of speech. </li></p>
                <li><p style="color:#0000FF"> Right to freedom of thought. </li></p>
                <li><p style="color:#0000FF">Right to freedom of forced labour (Slavery)</li></p>
                <li><p style="color:#0000FF">Right to private & family life. </li></p>
                <li><p style="color:#0000FF">Right to ownership of property. </li></p>
            </ul>

<p style="color:#0000FF">NOTE: These right could be limited due to some reasons. e.g. Curfew, Libel, Sedition, State of Emergency. 
   If the court of law sentences a citizen to death because of a crime he committed, his right to life has been limited. Same as freedom of movement if he/she is imprisoned. </p>
