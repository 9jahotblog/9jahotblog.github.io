    <p><strong>Zeus</strong> - The king of the gods and ruler of Mount Olympus, Zeus is the god of the sky and thunder. He is known for his numerous affairs with both goddesses and mortal women, resulting in many offspring, including heroes like Hercules.

    <p><strong>Hera</strong> - The queen of the gods and the goddess of marriage and childbirth, Hera is both Zeus' sister and his wife. She is often depicted as a jealous and vengeful figure, particularly against Zeus' lovers and their offspring. In one myth, she punishes the mortal woman Semele, the mother of Dionysus, with a tragic death.

    <p><strong>Poseidon</strong> - The god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses, Poseidon is one of Zeus’ brothers. He is known for his volatile temper, which could cause storms and earthquakes. Poseidon’s most famous myth involves his contest with Athena for the patronage of the city of Athens.

    <p><strong>Demeter</strong> - The goddess of agriculture, fertility, and the harvest, Demeter is central to the myth of Persephone, her daughter. When Persephone was abducted by Hades and taken to the underworld, Demeter’s grief caused the earth to wither, leading to the creation of the seasons. Her joy at Persephone’s return brings spring and summer, while her sorrow during her daughter’s absence brings autumn and winter.</p>

She is a virgin goddess and was often depicted with an owl and a shield (Aegis) bearing the head of the Gorgon Medusa. Athena played a key role in various myths, including assisting heroes like Odysseus and Perseus. Her most significant myth is the creation of the first olive tree, which secured her role as the protector of Athens.</p>

He is the twin brother of Artemis and the son of Zeus and Leto.

However, she had many lovers, including Ares, the god of war.
