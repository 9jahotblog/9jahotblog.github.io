Hera was a very jealous type, & fought with Zeus over illegitimate children & affairs, she even turned Calisto into a bear, because Zeus fell in love with her & became the father to her child. 
     Hera continued to punish whoever Zeus had raped & bore children with, because she was jealous. She got married to her brother to hide her shame, Zeus kept wooing her but he wasn't able to win her over, that's why he turned himself into a pathetic bird, Hera felt pity & nursed the bird, he turned himself back into human & raped her.
