He was extremely strong to the extent he could even lift mountains, unlike Hercules his first son. 

<p style="color:#0000FF"> Hera </p>
  She is the goddess of marriage, she is a sister & wife to Zeus, goddess of women, family & childbirth. 
   She had the power to bless the people of Greece with good clear skies & also curse them. The women of Greece prayed to Hera for childbirth protection, good health, & good marriage. As the queen of mount Olympus, she was not benevolent but rather cruel towards anyone who crossed her. Hera was a very jealous type, & fought with Zeus over illegitimate children & affairs, she even turned Calisto into a bear, because Zeus fell in love with her & became the father to her child. 
     Hera continued to punish whoever Zeus had raped & bore children with, because she was jealous. She got married to her brother to hide her shame, Zeus kept wooing her but he wasn't able to win her over, that's why he turned himself into a pathetic bird, Hera felt pity & nursed the bird, he turned himself back into human & raped her.

 god of fertility, harvest & agriculture. She is also called Deo. Her brother "Hades" was in love with her daughter "Persephone" & abducted her to the underworld. Due to this, she cursed the world & land that caused plants to die and wither. 
     She bore her brother "Zeus" a son and a daughter. (Persephone & Lacchus). But never married.  Zeus commanded Hades to bring back Persephone but betrayed Demeter by involving in the rape of Persephone before. 
 The crops & earth died while Demeter left Zeus in search of her daughter. This is why Demeter is not counted among the Olympus gods at times.
