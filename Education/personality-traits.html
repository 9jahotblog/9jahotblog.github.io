    <p style="color:#0000FF"> TODAY'S TALK</p>
    <p style="color:#0000FF"> PERSONALITY TRAITS</p>
  
<p style="color:#0000FF">CONSCIENTIOUSNESS</p>
I have this feeling of being painstaking because anything could go wrong & anything could go right. I take whatever life throws or give me as a pre-determination. Or rather the spur of the moment, I expect whatever comes because I'm very careful about the steps I take. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">AGREEABLENESS</p>
In whatever cost or situation, I agree to terms & policies that may come rising. Because I believe that every cloud has a silver lining, I take full responsibility wether it's a wrong term or a right term I can turn the tables around. Anything can be fixed. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">NEUROTICISM</p>
Controlling one's mind, feelings, self & anger is the coolest thing to do. No matter the situation, I tend to respond conductively to it because loosing one's cool makes situations get worse. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">EXTRAVERSION</p>
I engage socially with people lovingly because it's one of the fun things to do. I obtain gratitude's outside & exchange pleasantries with strangers having in mind everyone is the same as me. Whatever color, race, tribe, ethnic & status doesn't matter to me, my ego always betrays me outside. Do I even have one? I'm free & I love nature, with no trust issues. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">OPENESS</p>
It's very easy to understand me, am very fathomable so as my characters, & I have a very fragile heart. I tell you what I feel at the right time am offended or pleased in whichever way you treat me, it's an immediate response because am not secretive.  

<p style="color:#0000FF">RESILIENCE</p>
Situations that require's solace arrive unexpectedly, this is why it's an incident or an accident. I might be mad or sad for a while, but one thing is for sure, I'll return to my normal self again in a few time. I don't wish for bad things to happen, neither do I wish to be offended, but if I am, give me some time, I might say some balderdash, but I'll still come to apologize to you & make amend what's broken because I easily find peace within myself & no one can hurt me. I might go hurt, but I'll come back strong. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">CURIOUSITY</p>
To me, everything just feels worthy of knowing about, am sometimes in a state of doubt or should I say a feeling of collecting more information about a thing, object or a person. 
I get this interest whenever the feeling comes & I make sure I learn more about what I saw, what I was told, or what I heard about. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>
 I comprehend, & I feel like a bard whenever I understand & profit from an experience or something I was taught, told, or saw. I internalize anything am taught so easily & I am very difficult to manipulate because I get so sure of myself & what I internalize. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">OPTIMISM</p>
I expect nothing but the best from all things, if I'm discouraged, I never feel down, rather I feel it's still going to turn out well, because a pessimist will not go far in life & what he contributes to. Optimism helps & if there's failure, it will only teach a lesson that an optimist should learn from, start again, & keep pushing. The best results only come out. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">FAIRNESS</p>
I conform with rules, standards & abide with whatever law is laid. I am an equalist & it's paying off whenever there's a situation that requires interference, fairness only wins & nothing else. Because this way, 2 or more individuals will be pleased, or should I say everyone? Everyone will be pleased because it's a win win thing for everybody. Everyone cannot be a winner, but everybody can feel like winner. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">RESPECTFULNESS</p>
Whoever you are I have a regard for you & your feelings. It's your life & you can live it, anybody's wishes will never be put to disrespect by me. I bring out the esteem in everyone wether old or young & make them feel honored. Admiration is the sweetest thing. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">RESPONSIBILITY</p>
I enjoy answering to conducts & shouldering up any activity that require's bringing balance & relief into the life of others. It's a commitment & it has been embeded in me that's why I don't get tired of doing it, as long as it takes nothing but strength & might. I accept accountability to choices. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">PERSEVERANCE</p>
If it's pleasing myself & making myself or the people around me happy, then count me in, cause I love doing these types of things continuously, so the joy in me or the people around me never dies. This activity must be beneficial & appropriate, if so, I don't mind doing it for the rest or my life. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">RELIABILITY</p>
This quality of being dependable is satisfying to me, it shows am not only worthy but trustworthy, honest & fair. This feels like combining all the positive personality traits into one which is "Reliability" for you to be trusted to be dependable upon, this means you have the quality in you & this is the coolest thing to do. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">SELF DISCIPLINE</p>
I deny myself a lot when it comes to tainting myself into doing a lot of acrimonious activities or things. It's not only about being acrid, could be trying to manage, be honest, careful & secure. It's not cruelty, it's controlling your impulses. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">CONSIDERATE</p>
It's cruel to think about only yourself, this is why I feel tactful to others. Whatever one does comes back to one according to the rule of Karma, apart from this, it happens & it's a life cycle. So I see no reason why people shouldn't show concern for the rights & feelings of others because we all matter. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">FORGIVING</p>
Everyone isn't perfect that's why I get tolerant towards living with anyone, extroverting towards places or anyone, & forgetting about the past. The past has nothing to do with one's present, if you fall yesterday doesn't mean you can't rise today, that's why I let go & show mercy to my fellow humans. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">ENCOURAGING</p>
If someone is optimistic & it turns to failure then even solace cannot be helpful to this individual, this is where encouragement comes, to reassure this individual to step up. I bring out the courage inside anybody, it's inbuilt, one just needs words of confidence & hope. Support helps in every form of failure. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">AMBITIOUSNESS</p>
The path to success gets floppy sometimes, but it can be narrow & easy at the same time, only if one drives for success. Present & future ambition matters, as long as you're driving for success. You can't stop but get through it, because failure is not an option. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">KINDNESS & GENEROSITY</p> 
  Being considerate is not only helping the individual one is to considerate to, it also helps the one who is being kind because one way or the other, kindness meets with who is kind. This is why one should not only be humane & sympathetic, but ready to give money, support or time to his fellow individuals.
