          <p><strong>Tera,</strong> an online store owner, has described how Blessing/Favor operating with the name Faboulous Collection duped members of her group out of over N70,000.</p>
          <p> "I basically run a pre-order group, and this lady started adding people from my group, and now her group has over 200 participants," Tera explained.
"The issue is that if she was actually adding people and selling goods to them, it would have been better and easier; I would simply warn her to stop adding people from my group." </p>
          <p> "However, what she does is add people from different groups and begin scamming them." She'd collect money for the market as well as money for the waybill. She has defrauded people out of over N70,000.
Tera explained that a member of her group called her yesterday and told her that someone in her group had scammed her.
</p>      <p></strong>VICTIMS AFFECTED</p></strong>

Becky a victim said that "Blessing enter my DM on Friday, at 7:11am and asked me to join her group, first I was skeptical that wouldn't it be the same group that I've been joining cos I've really mean in need of a geniune whole saler that would just shadow my many business needs. 
"so I joined and discovered that they were relatively cheap so I went back to her DM told her are you stealing this items cos they are so cheap and she said no, she does legit business, then I said okay no problem. 
"So I posted a few of her stuffs, then a customer wanted to buy, I was like these items  are too cheap to be true. I said before I would start paying gbese to customers, let me buy something for my self first, if it comes, we can now do business. </p>
          
          <p>"On Saturday I sent a message telling her I haven't seen it, so she gave me a driver number which was switched off and still switched off till now."
Another victim named Mercy stated "The lady who approached me introduced herself as Blessing and expressed her desire to add me to her group.
"She informed me that she sells low-cost clothing, palms, bags, slippers, and other items.
 </p>
     <p>"When I told her I was in Kano, she sent me a link to join her WhatsApp group. I asked where she operates from, and she said Lagos State. She also said she does waybilling. She removed me after I discovered she was a swindler."
Mercy revealed that if she had defrauded you of your money, she would remove you from the group and block you on all platforms.
<p>Yabatech Radio tried to verify this claim by texting the number on WhatsApp. But there was no response to the message sent. When this reporter dialed the number of Faboulous Collection it kept on saying switched off until now.  </p>
     <p><strong>WHAT THE LAW SAYS ABOUT 419 SCAMS<p></strong>
In Nigeria, Criminal Code Section 419 states: â€œAny person who by any false pretence, and with intent to defraud, obtains from any other person anything capable of being stolen, or induces any other person to deliver to any person anything capable of being stolen, is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for three years.
