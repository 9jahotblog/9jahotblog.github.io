     <p><strong>"I'm sorry sir...we lost them,"</strong> the doctor said and hung up.</p>

<p>Fear hung in Michael's throat, his Adam's apple moving up and down like a cotton candy machine. <strong>"Damn!"</strong> he yelled, sat on the couch, and buried his face in his palms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The previous night, before the death of Michael's friends, they had all gone to the club and enjoyed life to the fullest. When they were leaving, Michael met a young lady at the bar who told him her sad story and explained that she was only at the club to pay her school fees and other bills.</p>

<p>Michael promised to pay her well if she satisfied his sexual urge. She was left with no other choice than to follow Michael home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When they arrived home, Isabella was afraid, but she couldn't go back anyway. She was alone with four men in a big mansion without anyone knowing her whereabouts.</p>

<p><strong>"Babe... what's wrong?"</strong> Michael asked, slightly incredulous.</p>

<p>Isabella nodded her head and followed Michael to his room upstairs. Michael's friends remained in the lounge, discussing how hot the girl was. Michael heard them but pretended as if he didn't hear.</p>

<p>When they got upstairs, Isabella was stunned by how luxurious the room was. She imagined the amount she would get paid if she satisfied her client's sexual urge.</p>

<p><strong>"What are you waiting for...take off your dress,"</strong> Michael said.</p>

<p><em>"Okay..."</em> Isabella nodded and began taking off her short gown. It seemed she had swallowed her fear and chewed her guilt. All she could remember at that moment was her school fees and her landlord, who was always asking her to sleep with him if she couldn't pay the house rent.</p>

<p>Isabella took off her dress and was left with only her panties and bra. She held the edge of the bed tightly and wrapped her lips together. <em>"Lord, please forgive me because I am about to commit a mortal sin."</em></p>

<p><strong>"Are you talking to me?"</strong> Michael asked where he stood, putting on his protection. When he realized that Isabella didn't respond, he whirled around. He was aroused when he saw Isabella's boobs and clear skin. <strong>"Wow!"</strong> he said.</p>

<p>He walked slowly toward her. Isabella kept her legs wrapped together and her hands tightly on the bed, her heart pounding like it would uproot from her chest. <em>"What..."</em> she muttered.</p>

<p>Michael leaned over to her, hurriedly grabbed her waist, and held her long brownie hair with his left hand. He started kissing her neck like a little boy licking his ice cream, then found where her nipple tape was tied together. He made her fall on her back and then removed the nipple tape.</p>

<p>He laid completely on her, groaning like a wounded cub. He moved his head back to hers and pictured her lips in his head. Isabella let out a soft moan and held Michael's neck. They started kissing hurriedly without letting any breath escape from their mouths.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Michael could no longer control his urge, so he took the duvet and covered them both. Within a blink of an eye, Isabella's noise filled the whole house, and Michael was sweating like a Christmas goat.</p>

<p><strong>"I am in pain!"</strong> Isabella cried out.</p>

<p><strong>"Enough!"</strong> Michael shouted and stood up from the bed.</p>

<p>Michael took his shorts from the floor, wore them, and then walked out of the room. Isabella covered her body with the duvet and sobbed like a spirit that had descended from a river.</p>

<p>Michael's friends, who were already eager to know how it was, jumped up when they saw Michael coming downstairs.</p>

<p><strong>"Guy, what's up?"</strong> Billy asked.</p>

<p>Michael frowned and sat on the couch like a disappointed mariner. He buried his face in his hands and didn't reply to his friends.</p>

<p><strong>"Bro, tell us, the girl is hot?"</strong> Drake asked excitedly.</p>

<p>Michael was so agitated by their questions that he stood up angrily. <strong>"Look, look guys. That girl up there in my room is a virgin!"</strong> he said and walked to the TV, shaking his head.</p>

<p><em>"She's what?"</em> they all asked in unison and laughed.</p>

<p>Michael frowned at them and walked to the kitchen. They all followed him and asked if they could have the girl as well.</p>

<p><strong>"What! You mean four of us will sleep with a girl?"</strong> he yelled.</p>

<p><strong>"No, guy, we won't do it together,"</strong> Billy said and exited the kitchen.</p>

<p>Michael was confused, so he didn't know what to decide on. He just said <em>"well...you see"</em> and all of them ran to the lounge, waiting for their turns.</p>

<p>After a few hours, it was already 3:00 a.m., and Billy, the last person to have sex with Isabella, ran downstairs half-naked.</p>

<p><strong>"Guys!!!"</strong> he shouted, and they all woke up, asking him why he was shouting like a moron.</p>

<p><strong>"Guys!! That girl...up there...argg!!!"</strong> Billy stammered as tears continued rolling down his face.</p>

<p><strong>"Listen, Billy, tell us what's happening!"</strong> Don said as he wiped his sweaty face.</p>

<p><strong>"Okay, guys... that girl in Michael's room is dead,"</strong> Billy said.</p>

<p><strong>"What! Dead? How?"</strong> Michael asked, and he was about to run upstairs when Don and Drake held him back.</p>

<p><strong>"Dude, see, things like this happen. Let's just dump her body somewhere,"</strong> Drake said.</p>

<p><strong>"Yes, buddy, let's dump her. It's 3:20 a.m., no one would see us,"</strong> Don said and sat down.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, they all agreed to dump her body along with her bag. Don drove them to a quiet place where they dumped Isabella's body.</p>

<p>They all went back home and freshened up. Immediately after the sun rose, they left Michael's house.</p>

<p>Immediately after they left, Michael received a call from the Western hospital that three guys had had an accident in a black Mercedes Benz and their condition was very critical. The caller even added that one of them claimed to have seen a ghost on the highway when he could talk, and Michael hadn't recovered from the shock of the accident when the doctor called later and said they were all dead.</p>

<p><em>"The ghost"</em> that he heard kept ringing in his head, and fear gripped his soul.</p>

<p>Since last night, Michael hadn't changed from the shorts he was wearing, nor had he taken a bath. He was more terrified than a dog that saw a tiger.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the lounge when he started hearing some strange laughter from the kitchen. He stood up and tiptoed to the kitchen, and when he didn't see anything, he decided to go back to the lounge.</p>

<p>As he was about to lift his left heel, the strange laughter started again. <strong>"Please! Spare me!"</strong> Michael got on his knees and begged. After a few minutes, the strange laughter changed to whispering.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the light went off, and Michael crawled to the freezer. He held the handle of the freezer, hoping there would be light from it, and immediately after he opened it, the air that gushed out of the freezer blew him away, causing him to hit his head on the counter. <strong>"Please...spare me!"</strong></p>

<p><strong>"Spare you?"</strong> the strange voice smirked.</p>

<p>Before Michael could realize it, a young lady appeared in a golden dress with a crown on her head. <strong>"Spare you?"</strong> she said again.</p>

<p>Michael leaned up and glanced at the woman standing in front of him. <strong>"Isabella?"</strong> he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The young woman smirked and pressed his head back with the staff in her hand. <strong>"Are you surprised?"</strong> she asked without expecting an answer.</p>

<p><strong>"Aren't you dead?"</strong> Michael asked fearfully.</p>

<p>The young woman leaned over to Michael, who was shivering like a caught fish on the floor, and rubbed his chest. <strong>"My love, are you shying away from me?"</strong> she smirked and caressed his chest.</p>

<p><strong>"You want to know if I'm dead or not?"</strong></p>

<p>Michael quickly nodded his head and avoided glancing at the sexy woman in front of him.</p>

<p><strong>"Yes! I am dead,"</strong> she said, and Michael shouted as if his left eye had been unplugged from its socket.</p>

<p><em>"Please..."</em> Michael cried, his voice trembling with fear.</p>

<p><strong>"Yes, my love, I am dead. I am only here to take what belongs to me. Your friends have already paid their debts."</strong> She moved closer to Michael, her eyes gleaming with a chilling intent.</p>

<p><em>"Please spare me!"</em> Michael cried, his voice cracking under the weight of his terror.</p>

<p><strong>"What belongs to me is your long and veiny penis! I won’t leave without it,"</strong> she thundered, her voice echoing through the room like a death sentence.</p>

<p><em>"No! No!!"</em> Michael cried, crawling back in a desperate attempt to escape.</p>

<p>She smirked at him and slowly brought out a dagger from a quiver slung across her back. <strong>"See this?"</strong> She showed him the dagger, licking its blade with a wicked grin.</p>

<p><strong>"Come here,"</strong> she commanded in a low, sultry voice, and Michael, trembling, obeyed her immediately.</p>

<p><strong>"Good boy, now take off that stinking short,"</strong> she ordered, her tone growing more menacing with each word.</p>

<p>Michael was shocked, his body stiffening like a rat that had swallowed a fish's bone.</p>

<p><strong>"Don’t get me angry now... come to mama!"</strong> She coaxed, and Michael, shaking, quickly moved towards her.</p>

<p>As soon as he was close enough, she grabbed his penis and placed the dagger on his thigh, her touch cold and terrifying. She started rubbing his thigh and penis, while Michael pleaded bitterly for his life.</p>

<p><strong>"Now say bye to what makes you a man and welcome a miserable life!"</strong> She laughed, a cruel, mirthless sound that sent chills down Michael's spine.</p>

<p>Michael moved back, shaking his head frantically. <em>"No! No!! Don’t do this!"</em> he begged.</p>

<p>She grabbed Michael’s neck, pulling him close, and pressed her lips onto his in a harsh, punishing kiss. She made him fall on his back and covered his face with her hand, her grip unrelenting.</p>

<p>When she realized Michael wasn't looking, she swiftly took the dagger and, with a single motion, chopped off his penis. Blood gushed out from the wound, and Michael screamed like a goat trapped in a hive of bees.</p>

<p><em>"Ugh!!!"</em> Michael shouted and jumped up from the couch where he had been lying. When he opened his eyes, he saw his friends in front of him, smiling.</p>

<p><strong>"Guy, aren’t you going to the club again?"</strong> one of his friends asked, their faces full of concern.</p>

<p>He looked at them, then quickly glanced down at his manhood, checking to see if it was still intact. <em>"What are you guys doing here?"</em> he asked, his voice filled with confusion and lingering fear.</p>

<p>His friends looked at each other, puzzled. <strong>"What are you talking about?"</strong> they asked him, concern evident in their voices.</p>

<p>Michael suddenly realized everything had been a dream. Without giving them a chance to sit down and rest, he chased them out like Chihuahuas, his heart still pounding in his chest.</p>

<p>He went back to his room and started thanking God that everything had just been a nightmare.</p>
