<p style="color:#0000FF">unit2: US BANK STOCKS</p>

The concept of bank stocks can be quite confusing to those that do not take time to study it and understand. Here, I will be explaining bank stocks like I would to a 10-year-old. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">First, what are bank stocks</p>

A law dictionary by John Bouvier that was published in 1856 and was adapted to the constitution and Laws of the United States, defines bank stocks to be the ‚Äúcapital of a bank usually divided in shares of a certain amount. This stick is generally transferable on the books of the bank and is considered as a personal property.‚Äù

This means that,bank stocks can be bought and they can also be transferred.

Thus, in a layman‚Äôs term, bank stocks are ways to invest your money in a bank and get regular interests. 

Now, in selecting what bank stock to invest in. You have to consider the dividends that is, the distribution of corporate profits to eligible shareholders. As an investor in bank stocks no matter how little you invest, you are automatically a shareholder therefore you have to consider how much returns your investment is set to bring, before you invest. 

Now, in considering dividends you have to check for Consistency, inflation and reinvestment. Ensure you invest with a bank that pays dividends consistently, have a history to stay afloat during inflation and are interested In reinvesting major parts of the profits to bring in more interest.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Is it advisable to buy US Bank Stocks?</p>


Well, yes but it depends on some major factors.

Here‚Äôs the thing, the US stock market is very enticing and the best choice when you want to diversify your portfolio along many geographies because of the fact that the US market has a broad relationship with many other markets like China and the US is also said to house some of the best technology and it offers great investment opportunities.

However, before you invest in US Bank Stocks you have to consider some major factors like:
<p style="color:#0000FF">1. Geographic Diversification ( That is, the relationship between the US and other markets)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">2. Impact of Foreign exchange between your country and the US because your country would charge a Foreign exchange conversation fee on every of your transaction and you don‚Äôt want to lose all your profits on bank charges.</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">3. Taxation: check the taxation rate and it would be more preferable if your country has a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with the US. It will help you prevent tax on the same income, twice.</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">3. Life Goals: if you have plans to study or relocate abroad, it would be more beneficial if you have stocks as it would make visa processing and all other payments easier. </p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">How do you invest in bank stocks?</p>

 To invest in the US bank stocks, you need to have a brokerage account which can be created on many online platforms or you could register with an online verified stockbroker,fund your account and buy stocks through them.
