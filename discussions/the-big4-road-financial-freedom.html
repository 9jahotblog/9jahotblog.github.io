<p style="color:#0000FF"> CRYPTOCURRENCIES</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">Unit1: Let's Start with CRYPTOCURRENCY</p>


<p style="color:#0000FF">The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.</p> The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.  While Bitcoin may have been the first major cryptocurrency to hit the market – it debuted in 2009 – many others have become highly popular, even if not quite as large as the original.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Bitcoin is derived from compilation of satoshi and it was the first major coin to be listed/valued in the crypto market.</p> At a time in the beginning it was mined and at an affordable rate until its value rised to a point. it's mineability was very expensive because of it's high value at the time people had only one option that was and still is to invest by outright purchase.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Today we have hundreds of various cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, litecoin, Doge coin , Usdc , etc amongst many.</p> These crypto coin vary in value due to its investors and demand (volatility). Till date we still have various crypto rising in value in competition with it highest counterpart (bitcoin). 

<p style="color:#0000FF">Platforms such as binance have developed tokens (BNB) to enable smart chain swaps on various platforms.</p> It's close rival to hard currency trade on the forigen exchange market has made it a better platform to invest your assets on tokens which is very stable in value unlike hard currency exchange which you could lose a lot of cash in the exchange or docile process. 

<p style="color:#0000FF">Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency issued by Binance, among the largest crypto exchanges in the world.</p> While originally created as a token to pay for discounted trades, Binance Coin can now be used for payments as well as purchasing various goods and services.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Crypto currency has know to sky rocket over 1000 x in a short period : such interest has never and can never be recorded in hard currency trade /exchange. The long and short of it is: Crypto Currency is the currency for this generation and the next to come and it is evident from the rise of it users and it level of acceptance on various online plat form for trade (buying and selling) and transaction friendly.</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">Another Perspective to CRYPTOCURRENCY</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">What is cryptocurrency?</p>
A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. These wallets can be software that is a cloud-based service or is stored on your computer or on your mobile device. The wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity and link to your cryptocurrency.

<p style="color:#0000FF">How does Cryptocurrency Transactions Work?</p>
Cryptocurrencies transactions occur through electronic messages that are sent to the entire network with instructions about the transaction. The instructions include information such as the electronic addresses of the parties involved, the quantity of currency to be traded, and a time stamp.
Suppose Mimi wants to transfer one unit of cryptocurrency to Abraham. Mimi starts the transaction by sending an electronic message with her instructions to the network, where all users can see the message. Mimi's transaction is one of a number of transactions that have recently been sent. Since the system is not instantaneous, the transaction sits with a group of other recent transactions waiting to be compiled into a block (which is just a group of the most recent transactions). The information from the block is turned into a cryptographic code and miners compete to solve the code to add the new block of transactions to the blockchain.
Once a miner successfully solves the code, other users of the network check the solution and reach an agreement that it is valid. The new block of transactions is added to the end of the blockchain, and Mimi's transaction is confirmed. (This confirmation is not instant as it takes time for six blocks of transactions to be processed so that users can be certain that their transaction has been successful.)
<p style="color:#0000FF">What are the risks to using cryptocurrency?</p> 
Cryptocurrencies are still relatively new, and the market for these digital currencies is very volatile. Since cryptocurrencies don't need banks or any other third party to regulate them; they tend to be uninsured and are hard to convert into a form of tangible currency (such as US dollars or euros.) In addition, since cryptocurrencies are technology-based intangible assets, they can be hacked like any other intangible technology asset. Finally, since you store your cryptocurrencies in a digital wallet, if you lose your wallet (or access to it or to wallet backups), you have lost your entire cryptocurrency investment.
<p style="color:#0000FF">What Are Some of the Public Policy Implications?</p>
Some of the technology behind cryptocurrencies raises a number of considerations for public policymakers. Given the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency systems, and their worldwide reach, there are questions about how to limit the use of digital currencies for criminal activities. In addition, the current fascination with cryptocurrencies has potentially added to the speculative nature of these markets, and has raised concerns around consumer protection. If cryptocurrencies were to be more widely adopted, they could also present some challenges for the role of the banking sector and raise additional financial stability concerns in a crisis. Furthermore, the vast amounts of electricity used in the mining of cryptocurrency raise concerns about the allocation of resources and environmental consequences of these payment systems.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Spot Trading and Future Trading.</p>

Spot Trading is a situation whereby we buy coins and hodl (hodl is a technical term in trading it means keeping a coin). For example, I buy a $50 dollar worth of bitcoin and keep, for a long period of time, during the period of holding, the coin rises and falls you still make your money. 
Spot trading is for Unprofessionals.

Future trading, is where the BIG BOYS trade, the ones with enough money and enough knowledge on how to read and predict the market. 
I'm future trading, you don't hodl coins, you buy and trade instantly.

Concerning future trading, you'd buy and sell, this type of trading is very risky and very very difficult to understand for new learners, you'd need an expert in the field (someone who trades future only). You can make millions in a minute and also lose millions in 30 seconds in future trading


<p style="color:#0000FF">Where am I driving at?</p>
Basically, if you want to invest in cryptocurrency, my advice is to start with spot trading so you'd not end up losing money. You keep, and hodl.

<p style="color:#0000FF">Apps to use?</p>
Binance is the best app to trade on for me. But you have to go through a process to verify your account (you'd use your NIN or any valid ID card) without verification you'd not be able to trade. They have a very tight security, you can check coins that are hot 🔥 in the market (coins that are appreciating) and also coins  that are depreciating. You can buy coins directly from binance and also sell to them. You can also buy and sell NFT's.

Trust Wallet also is ok, but you only receive and send.

You can buy from vendors also as you buy your recharge cards from people, people also sell cryptocurrencies, they'd give you their rates, and you'd send them your wallet address.

ONLY BUY FROM PEOPLE YOU TRUST!!.

Lastly, I advise you buy $10 each of like 5-6 coins just for a start then, you'd increase your investment whenever you have enough money.

<p style="color:#0000FF">DO NOT BUY SHITCOINS</p> (SHITCOINS are coins with little or no market value) e.g 
Safe moon, Shiba inu, Apecoin.
