    <p style="color:#0000FF"> Today's Discussion</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">AFFILIATE MARKETING</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">WHAT IS AFFILIATE MARKETING?</p>
It is a simple business model that involves promoting other people's products or services and getting a paid commission for doing so...
<p style="color:#0000FF">Example of Affilate Marketing</p>
In a lame mans term:-
One way or the other, you're marketing something but you don't get paid, you bought a roll of sausage, your friend tasted it, he asked where you got it, you referred him, he went there to buy for himself and friends and then, the referrals keep spreading but you weren't paid, you just advertised a product to your friend without the company knowing or paying you i.e Affilate Marketing.
 Before we go into the second question, I'd like to state one or two benefits of affiliate marketing..
<p style="color:#0000FF">Benefits of doing affiliate marketing</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">â€¢Its very easy to start and set up. You can start it from your room</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">â€¢You only need a smart phone</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">â€¢You don't need to create any product</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">â€¢You can be a student, corper or a 9-5 worker and still do affiliate marketing, you just need like 2-3 hours of your time daily</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">â€¢You don't need to hire anyone and have to deal with any problem.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">â€¢You won't bother about delivery, your own is to get customers and get your commission</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">â€¢You can make as much as 100k-500k every month even as a beginner.</p>

<p style="color:#0000FF">Things an Affiliate marketer can do or work as!</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Realtor</p>
(Marketing Estate properties, rental & shortlet apartments)
<p style="color:#0000FF">Freelancing</p>
(Marketing Freelance courses and works)
<p style="color:#0000FF">Social media Manager</p>
(Some companies or vendors employ affiliate marketers to help them handle their social media accounts and generate sales for them)
<p style="color:#0000FF">Advertising Firm/Agency</p>
(An Affiliate Marketer can work at an Advertising Firm or agency)
<p style="color:#0000FF">Marketer for any company at all</p>
(An Affiliate Marketer can work at any company so far the company sells products or services)
<p style="color:#0000FF">Entrepreneur/ E-Commerce</p>
(An experienced Affiliate Marketer can be able to promote their products effectively and generate sales for their brand)
<p style="color:#0000FF">They are a lot more things an affiliate marketer can do to make money</p> if he/she has the opportunity but you must have a very good experience before you can do most of the things listed above.
Companies like Jumia, Uber, Amazon and Real Estate Companies use Affiliate marketing as a medium to get customers. You can apply as an affiliate marketer for Amazon or any real estate company and start making money from getting them sales or clients but you have to be skilled before you can be able to market any products.
We also have affiliate programs that you can register on and start making money from promoting products, every affiliate program has different products you can market, you'll see the products prices, the commission you'll get after marketing it, some products come with 40%, 50% or 60% commission.
We have international affiliate programs or sites like Jvzoo, Clickbank... these re popular Affiliate programs that have more than 1000 products owned by different merchants or vendors so if you register on these programs you'll see different products (digital or physical) products you can market but they don't allow Nigerians because they believe we're scammers except maybe you use a different profile but its quite risky.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Although, we have our local Affilate marketing program in Nigeria</p> we all know it or might have come across it, it's called "Expertnaire".
When you register with Expertnaire you'll have access to more than 80 different products that you can market but before you can market these products you'll need to learn how to if you need to make sales, if you just register with any of these affiliate programs without interest you might not find it easy.
5 step system that you need to know when marketing a product;
<p style="color:#0000FF">Step 1- Getting the right product or service you want to market.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Step 2- Study and understand the product and how it works before promoting it.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Step 3- Creating a Sales Process.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Step 4- Follow up and Closing with your leads.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Step 5- Tracking sale to ensure you get paid.</p>

This is all for now, 
Next time, we'd be talking about the dangers of doing this cause all businesses has their shortcomings.
