    <p style="color:#0000FF"> AUTISM </p>
    <p style="color:#0000FF">SYMPTOMS</p>
    <p style="color:#0000FF">PROBLEMS & More.....</p>
                             
    <p style="color:#0000FF">WHAT IS AUTISM??</p>
Autism or autism spectrum disorder is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions. These conditions are characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and non-verbal communication. ASD is found in people around the world regardless of race, ethicality, culture or economic background. 
<p style="color:#0000FF">Because autism is a spectrum disorder,</p> each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think ad problem-solve can vary from highly skilled to severely challenged some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives while other may need less support and in some case live entirely independently {just like Shaun from the ‚ÄúGOOD DOCTOR‚Äù}.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Several factors may influence the development of autism</p> and it is often accompanied by sensory sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal disorders, seizures, sleep disorders as well as mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues,
<p style="color:#0000FF">What are the symptoms of Autism?</p>
There are no medical tests such as blood or imaging tests, that can help expects diagnose autism, instead doctors examine a person‚Äôs behavior and development. Autism is spectrum disorder and that means it includes a range of linked conditions, symptoms also extending to include singular symptoms or traits. All this however, varies from person to person.
Signs of autism appears by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The DMS-5 divides symptoms of ASD into the following categories:
<p style="color:#0000FF">Problems with communication and social interactions.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior or activities.</p>
To be diagnosed with autism a person must experience symptoms in both of these categories.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Problems with communication and social interaction</p>
ASD can involve a range of difficulties with communication, many of which appear before age 5.
Here‚Äôs a general timeline of what this might look like:

From birth: trouble with maintaining eye contact.
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 9 months: not responding to their name.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 9 months: not displaying facial expressions reflective of their emotions. (Like surprise and anger).</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 12 months: not engaging in basic interactions games. (Like peek-a-boo or pat-a-cake)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 12 months: not using) or only using a few_ hand gestures. (Like hand waving).</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 15 months: not sharing their interests with others (for example- not showing someone a favorite toy)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 18 months: not pointing or looking where others point.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 24 months: not noticing when others appear sad or hurt.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 30 months: not engaging in ‚Äúpretend paly‚Äù. (Like caring for a baby doll or play with figurines)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 36 months: having trouble expressing their feelings or understanding those of others.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">By 60 months of age: not playing turn taking games.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">As they age, they might have difficulty talking or very limited speaking skills.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Other children with autism might development language skills at an uneven pace. (For example: if there‚Äôs a topic particularly interesting to them, they might develop a very strong vocabulary for talking about that one topic. But they might have difficulty communicating about other things).</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">They might also show signs of hyperlexia,</p> which involves reading beyond what‚Äôs expected of their age, children on the autism spectrum might learn to read as early as age 2. But they tend to not comprehend what they are reading.
<p style="color:#0000FF">As they interact with others,</p> children that have autism might have some difficulty with non-verbal communication. (Like maintaining eye contact or body language, might also remain difficult). These challenges with communication might persist throughout adulthood.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Note: hyperlexia does not always accompany autism, research suggests nearly 84% of children with hyperlexia are on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior or activities.</p>
Autism also includes symptoms related to body movements and behavior and these may include:
<p style="color:#0000FF">Repetitive movements, (like rocking, flapping their arms, spinning or running back and forth.)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Lining objects, (like toys up in stick orders and getting upset when that order is disturbed).</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Attachment to strict routines, like those around bedtime or getting to school.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Repeating words or phrases they hear someone say over and over again.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Getting upset at minor changes.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Focusing intently on parts of objects, (like on parts wheel of a toy truck or the hair of a doll.)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Unusual reactions to sensory inputs, (like sounds, smells and tastes.)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Obsessive interests.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Exceptional abilities, (like musical talent or memory capabilities.)</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">STIMMIMG.</p>
‚ÄúStimming‚Äù is term used to describe self Stimming behaviors, often involving repetitive movement‚Äôs motions or speech. (For example: someone might clap their hands, rub an object or repeating a phrase). Even though typically associated with people that have autism, but nearly everyone does some form of Stimming whether that‚Äôs rubbing their hands together or biting their nails. 
<p style="color:#0000FF">For people that have autism,</p>Stimming can sometimes get in the way of daily life or cause physical harm. But it can also serve as a helpful coping mechanism for dealing with sensory overload or navigating uncomfortable situations.
<p style="color:#0000FF">What are the causes of ASD?</p>
Autism spectrum disorder is not a disease or illness, so there is no known cause. The most recent research explains  that there‚Äôs no single cause.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Is autism a disorder or a disability?</p>
In order to understand the different perspectives of autism, it will help to know the difference between a disorder and a disability.
<p style="color:#0000FF">A disorder is a health condition,</p> that affects the typical functions of the mind and body. Specifically a mental disorder involves cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems. From a medical perspective autism is a mental disorder, this is because of the neurological, psychological and social impact it can have on one‚Äôs life.
While,
According to the center of disease control and prevention‚Ä¶ 
A disability is any condition of the body and mind that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities and interact with the world around them. Legally autism is considered a disability, that‚Äôs because its symptoms can make it difficult for a person to navigate neurological norms. This means that people with autism are protected under disabilities act.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Medically and legally,</p> autism is considered a disorder and a disability, respectively. But when it comes to self-identification, this isn‚Äôt always the case. In other words, some people identify as disabled or disordered while others don‚Äôt. 
In conclusion, Autism like everything else is complex and broad, and the more you learn about it the more complicated it gets. So I will be making this a series so that as I learn and research I can share as well.
