    <p style="color:#0000FF">IMPACT MAKING</p>
    <p style="color:#0000FF">By Genamie</p>
   
<p style="color:#0000FF">Today, someone randomly asked me a question and I quote “what does failure mean to me?”</p> It came unexpectedly, I couldn’t fast track my brain to come up with a reasonable answer so I said “I don’t know” and then he said and I quote “to me it means living all I have to live in this world and die without making an IMPACT.” when he said that the question that got stuck in my mind is “what is impact?”, “what does making impact, mean?”
<p style="color:#0000FF">If I’m a doctor and I save lives every day, I’m I making enough IMPACT.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">If I’m a firefighter and I save lives every day, I’m I making enough IMPACT.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">If I’m a teacher grooming and teaching the future of the world, am I making IMPACT at all?</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">If I’m a mother and I’m bring up the leaders of tomorrow, can that be considered as IMPACT?</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">This analysis basically takes us back to “what is IMPACT?”</p> Dictionary says “to have an important or noticeable effect on someone or something.” The dictionary also defines “MAKER” as “someone who does something or makes something happen.” So that means an IMPACT MAKER in this world is someone who has an important and noticeable effect in this world. "Noticeable" is where my problem with this definition is at. None ever noticed the impact a good mother makes in bringing up good children that become good adults that eventually become responsible human beings. Also no one ever notices the impact of a good teacher that grooms and teaches students not just academically as they are not paid enough to do, but morally because he or she wants the students to have a better life which will in turn make those student responsible.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Neither is it often for someone to consciously or noticeably appreciate a nurse.</p>Have you ever been to a hospital or watched a medically oriented movie say good doctor, you would notice that it’s the nurses that gives the drugs, show care, enquire about what they need to make them more comfortable. To be honest I would be undoubtedly grateful to the doctor that fixed my spine but I’m sure to also thank the nurse that carried me to the toilet when I couldn’t walk. At this juncture, I hope I have not confused you but convinced you that an impact doesn’t have to be noticed by the world to be an IMPACT…. It just has to have a positive effect on the world to be an IMPACT.
<p style="color:#0000FF">So give a standing ovation to the doctors,</p> clap your hands for those flying to the moon and inventing electricity, just remember to constantly say THANKYOU to your parents, teachers, nurses or any other person making a positively impacting this world.
<p style="color:#0000FF">Are you or anyone you know making an impact in the world, and you think it’s underappreciated….</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">Tell me about it, let’s get familiar in the comments section.</p>
