       <p> Kevin Owens & Seth Freakin Rollins lost their match against Riddle & Randy Orton. The winner was said to be eligible for this year's WrestleMania. 
Since KO & Seth lost it was a devastating moment for them. Riddle used the opportunity of Seth & KO at the end of the match, it was a triple threat. {Ko & Rollins}, {Riddle & Randy}, {Shorty G & Otis}.
KO had gave RKO to Shorty & Seth had included "burn it down", at the moment of counting.... Riddle flipped Rollins outta the ring & took the win. 
KO had to get another opportunity to go to WrestleMania so he thought Stone Cold was the best way. Ko said.. 
<p style="color:#0000FF">"There's nobody like me, and Steve Austin obviously knows that," said Owens. "Or maybe it's this unreasonable pride that he's got for Texas. My history with Texas really struck a chord with him. But Steve and I have a lot of history actually. I met him at an airport in 2005 when I was an independent wrestler just trying to make my way. I remember asking him for advice and he gave me a piece of advice that changed the entire trajectory of my career. Years later, I was on his podcast. Some years later, I asked him if he'd be okay with me using the Stunner. He was more than happy to tell me I could, to give me his blessing. So there's a lot of history there and I think it's unfortunate that my issues with Texas seem to have rubbed him the wrong way. But the important part is that he accepted my invitation."</p>
<p> Kevin Owens impersonated Stone Cold's bald head, dressing & style of fighting. Plus, he drank on stage just like stone cold & delivered an neck-breaker to the person throwing the drinks. He couldn't grab it so fast because he isn't stone cold obviously.. </p>
