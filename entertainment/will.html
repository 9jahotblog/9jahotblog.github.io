       <p> Following the host of the Oscars award 2022 by the 94th Academy Awards. American actor "Will Smith" hit Chris rock due to the mockery of the shaved hair of Will's wife "Jada Pinkett Smith" will was angered by this expensive joke of Chris
Who said... <p style="color:#0000FF">"Jada I love you, GI Jane 2 can't wait to see you"</p> Referring to Jada's shaved head. G.I. Jane is a 1997 American film starring Demi Moore (Charlies’ Angels: Full Throttle, General Hospital), which tells the fictional story of the first woman to go through special operations training, similar to that of the U.S Navy SEALs.
 Jada has Alopecia A medical term for loss of hair. 
Will in his PR wrote he can't joke about his wife medical's condition, this triggered him standing up to slap Chris & headed back to his seat.
Echoing <p style="color:#0000FF">"Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth"</p>twice. The laughing crowd became silent including Chris rock who was laughing at first.
Chris silently whispered <p style="color:#0000FF">This is the greatest night in the history of television..</p>
<p> Will wrote a PR later that night stating he is sorry for the step he took on Chris. See below.
<p style="color:#0000FF">"Violence in all of it's forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.
   I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love & kindness. 
   I would also like to apologize to the Academy, the producers of the show, all the attendees, and everyone watching around the world. I would like to apologize to the Williams Family and my King Richard Family. I deeply regret that my behavior has stained what has been an otherwise gorgeous journey for all of us. 

I am a work in progress. 

Sincerely."</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">See Will post his PR <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100044347093248/posts/544176300403935/?app=fbl">Here</a></p>
However, Nicki Minaj & few other celebs had spoken in favor of Will & some fans had spoken against. 
This didn't stop will from collecting the Oscars award. Additionally, Samuel I Jackson won his first Oscar & was presented by Denzel Washington. </p>
<p style="color:#0000FF"> Will Smith has been banned from attending the Oscars or associated events, virtually or either in person in 10 years because of the physical assault of Chris Rock. </p>
    Many production organizations  has been disassociating themselves from any movie project in development with the actor. Netflix fell through it's "Fast & Loose" thriller project which would've had Will Smith has the lead role. 
   Read full statement of the academy....
   <p style="color:#0000FF"> "The 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage.

During our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room. For this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short — unprepared for the unprecedented.

Today, the Board of Governors convened a meeting to discuss how best to respond to Will Smith’s actions at the Oscars, in addition to accepting his resignation. The Board has decided, for a period of 10 years from April 8, 2022, Mr. Smith shall not be permitted to attend any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards

We want to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances. We also want to thank our hosts, nominees, presenters and winners for their poise and grace during our telecast.

This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy. We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted."</p>
   
<p>In a post shared by Washington confirmed Smith's acceptance to the ban.</p>
<p style="color:#0000FF">"I  accept and respect the Academy’s decision".</p> Smith reportedly said... 
He resigned from the academy a week ago. Smith can be nominated, collect more awards, can keep the one he had collected March 27, but cannot show up to get them.
