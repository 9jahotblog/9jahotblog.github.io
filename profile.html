        "<p><strong>LONE RANGER</strong></p><p><i>I shivered as the cool wind blew dust into my eyes. I'd come for a long run before dawn by the beach, but now, I was winded.</i></p><p>My life was a suffocating mess and I needed the breathing space, so I took a much needed sabbatical from my job.</p><p>I was a pro-life and pro-God activist, making me automatically the target of every anti-Christ organisation. It was a good thing I was a lone ranger, with no family since my parents disowned me years ago because of my faith. The way the world had gone haywire, turning normalcy upside down, I just wished the return of the Lord was closer.</p>",
        "<p>All sorts of debauchery had been legalised all on the claim of human liberty. But when it came to mentions of truth, one was tagged a fanatic and was blatantly persecuted. As I was. I had received lots of threats. The most recent one that forced me to take this retreat was the lawsuit I was faced with a particular celebrity.</p><p>A popular popstar had sued me for allegedly defaming her. Her lyrics were clearly satanic and I'd only expressed my displeasure at how young people were being indoctrinated by her songs.</p>",
        "<p><i>I lay exhausted on the wet sand, spread eagle as I watch the sky light up with colours of the rising sun—pinks and oranges against a background of pale blue spotted with white fluffy clouds.</i></p><p>'Lord, I'm tired and exhausted. I don't think I can go on on this path. Everyone hates me. Can't you just come and take me home? Like right now.'</p><p>The voice of the Lord came softly on the wind.</p><p>'Those who wait upon me will renew their strengths. They will mount up with wings as eagles, they will run and not be weary, they will walk and not faint.'</p><p>I soaked in the word. I needed the reminder.</p>",
        "<p>A particular quote I'd read somewhere rang in my heart as I watched the crashing waves: <blockquote>'If you want to go fast go alone, but if you want to go far, go with others.'</blockquote></p><p>'Sam, there are many who haven't caved in to the system of this world. You need to find them and walk with them. Your lone ranger creed won't work anymore, son.'</p><p>As He spoke those words, I noticed a young brunette walking into the shallow waters with her surf board. She didn't seem to notice me and I was impressed that she wore a very modest swim suit as opposed to the bikini that was common place. I noticed the glint of the silver cross pendant she wore. I had a witness in my spirit that she was also a strong believer.</p>",
        "<p>She slid into the water and went under for such a long time that I panicked and considered diving in to rescue her from drowning.</p><p>Just as I was about to rise to her rescue, she came out sleek and wet, her face brimming with such joy and peace. I saw her clasp her hands in prayer and her lips moving. I watched her for a long time. She must have sensed my eyes because the moment she was done, she opened her eyes and looked straight at me with a beautiful smile.</p><p>'Go, speak to her,' the Lord's voice said.</p><p>'Lord? I'm ranting to you about my predicament. Asking you for a solution. Not this. I don't need a distraction right now.'</p><p>'She's the solution I'm providing you.'</p><p>I looked at the waves again as this nameless lady began to ride the next wave. I smiled, not minding one bit that God's choice for me was a gorgeous lady who was obviously crazily in love with Him and not ashamed to show it.</p><p><strong>AUTHOR: Praise Abraham</strong></p>"
